Parent topic: Federal Acquisition Regulation 25.000 Scope of part.  (a) 						      This part provides policies and procedures for- (1) 								        Acquisition of foreign supplies, services, and construction materials; and (2) 								        Contracts performed outside the United States. (b) 						      It implements  41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American; trade agreements; and other laws and regulations.  25.001 General.  (a) 41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American- (1) Restricts the purchase of supplies, that are not domestic end products, for use within the United States. A foreign end product may be purchased if the contracting officer determines that the price of the lowest domestic offer is unreasonable or if another exception applies (see subpart  25.1); and (2) Requires, with some exceptions, the use of only domestic construction materials in contracts for construction in the United States (see subpart  25.2). (b) The restrictions in the Buy American statute are not applicable in acquisitions subject to certain trade agreements (see subpart  25.4). In these acquisitions, end products and construction materials from certain countries receive nondiscriminatory treatment in evaluation with domestic offers. Generally, the dollar value of the acquisition determines which of the trade agreements applies. Exceptions to the applicability of the trade agreements are described in subpart  25.4. (c) The test to determine the country of origin for an end product under the Buy American statute (see the various country "end product" definitions in 25.003) is different from the test to determine the country of origin for an end product under the trade agreements, or the criteria for the representation on end products manufactured outside the United States (see 52.225-18). (1)               The Buy American statute uses a two-part test to define a "domestic end product" or "domestic construction material" (manufactured in the United States and a domestic content test). The domestic content test has been waived for acquisition of commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items, except a product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both (excluding COTS fasteners) (see             25.101(a) and 25.201(b)). (2) Under the trade agreements, the test to determine country of origin is "substantial transformation" (i.e., transforming an article into a new and different article of commerce, with a name, character, or use distinct from the original article). (3) For the representation at 52.225-18, the only criterion is whether the place of manufacture of an end product is in the United States or outside the United States, without regard to the origin of the components. (4) When using funds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5), the definition of "domestic manufactured construction material" requires manufacture in the United States but does not include a requirement with regard to the origin of the components. If the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel must be produced in the United States.  25.002 Applicability of subparts. The following table shows the applicability of the subparts. subpart  25.5 provides comprehensive procedures for offer evaluation and examples.

(b)          It applies to supplies acquired for use in the United States, including supplies acquired under contracts set aside for small business concerns, if- (1)             The supply contract exceeds the micro-purchase threshold; or (2)             The supply portion of a contract for services that involves the furnishing of supplies (e.g., lease) exceeds the micro-purchase threshold.  25.101 General.  (a)          The Buy American statute restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American statute,  E.O. 13881, and  E.O.           14005                              use a two-part test to define a domestic end product. (1)             The article must be manufactured in the United States; and (2)  (i)                Except for an end                 product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a                 combination of both, the cost of domestic components shall exceed                 60 percent of the cost of all the components, except that the                 percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in calendar years                 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting in                 calendar year 2029. But see paragraph (d) of this                 section.                In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, this domestic content test of the                Buy American statute has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items                (see 12.505(a)) (but see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section).  (ii)                               For an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both, the cost of foreign iron and steel must constitute less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end product (see the definition of "foreign iron and steel" at 25.003). The cost of foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. This domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners.               (b)          The Buy American statute applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the domestic content test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (c)          Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in            subpart  25.5                     . (d)  (1)             A contract with a period of              performance that spans the schedule of domestic content threshold              increases specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section shall be              required to comply with each increased threshold for the items in the              year of delivery, unless the senior procurement executive of the              contracting agency allows for application of an alternate domestic              content test for that contract under which the domestic content threshold              in effect at time of contract award will apply to the entire period of              performance for the contract. This authority is not delegable. The senior              procurement executive shall consult the Office of Management and Budget's              Made in America Office before allowing the use of the alternate domestic              content test.            (2)When a             senior procurement executive allows for application of an alternate domestic             content test for a contract— (i)See 25.1101(a)(1)(ii) or 25.1101(b)(1)(v) for use of the appropriate Alternate                clause to reflect the domestic content threshold that will apply to                the entire period of performance for that contract; and (ii)Use the fill-in at 52.213-4(b)(1)(xvii)(B) instead of including 52.225-1 Alternate I when using 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions—Simplified Acquisitions                (Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services).  25.102 Policy. Except as provided in 25.103, acquire only domestic end products for public use inside the United States.  25.103 Exceptions. When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting officer may acquire a foreign end product without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute: (a) Public interest. The head of the agency may make a determination that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest. This exception applies when an agency has an agreement with a foreign government that provides a blanket exception to the Buy American statute. (b) Nonavailability. The Buy American statute does not apply with respect to articles, materials, or supplies if articles, materials, or supplies of the class or kind to be acquired, either as end items or components, are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality. (1) Class determinations. (i) A nonavailability determination has been made for the articles listed in 25.104. This determination does not necessarily mean that there is no domestic source for the listed items, but that domestic sources can only meet 50 percent or less of total U.S. Government and nongovernment demand. (ii) Before acquisition of an article on the list, the procuring agency is responsible to conduct market research appropriate to the circumstances, including seeking of domestic sources. This applies to acquisition of an article as- (A) An end product; or (B) A significant component (valued at more than 50 percent of the value of all the components). (iii) The determination in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply if the contracting officer learns at any time before the time designated for receipt of bids in sealed bidding or final offers in negotiation that an article on the list is available domestically in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality to meet the requirements of the solicitation. The contracting officer must- (A) Ensure that the appropriate Buy American statute provision and clause are included in the solicitation (see 25.1101(a), 25.1101(b), or 25.1102); (B) Specify in the solicitation that the article is available domestically and that offerors and contractors may not treat foreign components of the same class or kind as domestic components; and (C) Submit a copy of supporting documentation to the appropriate council identified in 1.201-1, in accordance with agency procedures, for possible removal of the article from the list. (2) Individual determinations.  (i) The head of the                contracting activity may make a determination that an article,                material, or supply is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the                United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial                quantities of a satisfactory quality. A determination is not                 required before January 1, 2030, if there is an offer for a foreign                 end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content (see 25.106(b)(2) and 25.106(c)(2)).               (ii) If the contracting officer considers that the nonavailability of an article is likely to affect future acquisitions, the contracting officer may submit a copy of the determination and supporting documentation to the appropriate council identified in 1.201-1, in accordance with agency procedures, for possible addition to the list in 25.104. (3) A written determination is not required if all of the following conditions are present: (i) The acquisition was conducted through use of full and open competition. (ii) The acquisition was synopsized in accordance with 5.201. (iii) No offer for a domestic end product was received. (c) Unreasonable cost. The contracting officer may          determine that the cost of a domestic end product would be unreasonable, in          accordance with            25.106 and subpart  25.5.         (d) Resale. The contracting officer may purchase foreign end products specifically for commissary resale. (e) Information technology that is a commercial product.          The restriction on purchasing foreign end products does not apply to the acquisition of information technology that is a commercial product, when using fiscal year 2004 or subsequent fiscal year funds (section 535(a) of Division F, Title V, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts).  25.104 Nonavailable articles.

(c)          For determining reasonableness of cost for           domestic end products that contain critical components or are critical items (             see 25.106(c)).          25.106      Determining reasonableness of       cost.     (a) The contracting officer- (1) Must use the evaluation             factors in paragraphs (b) and (c) of              this              section             unless the head of the agency makes a written determination that the use of             higher factors is more appropriate. If the determination applies to all             agency acquisitions, the agency evaluation factors must be published in             agency regulations; and (2) Must not apply             evaluation factors to offers of eligible products if the acquisition is             subject to a trade agreement under               subpart  25.4.            (b) For end products that are not critical items and do not contain critical             components.         (1)  (i)                If there is a domestic offer                 that is not the low offer, and the restrictions of the Buy American                 statute apply to the low offer, the contracting officer must                 determine the reasonableness of the cost of the domestic offer by                 adding to the price of the low offer, inclusive of duty—               (A)                   20 percent, if the lowest                    domestic offer is from a large business concern; or                  (B)                   30 percent, if the lowest                    domestic offer is from a small business concern. The                    contracting officer must use this factor, or another factor                    established in agency regulations, in small business                    set-asides if the low offer is from a small business concern                    offering the product of a small business concern that is not                    a domestic end product (see subpart  19.5).                  (ii)                The price of the domestic offer                 is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low                 offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in                 accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)(1)(i) of this section. See                 evaluation procedures at subpart  25.5.               (2)  (i)                For end products that are not                 COTS items and do not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or                 steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in paragraph                 (b)(1)(i) of this section result in an unreasonable cost                 determination for the domestic offer or there is no domestic offer                 received, and the low offer is for a foreign end product that does                 not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the contracting officer                 shall—               (A)                   Treat the lowest offer of                    a foreign end product that is manufactured in the United                    States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic                    offer; and                  (B)                   Determine the                    reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the                    evaluation factors listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this                    section to the low offer.                  (ii)                The price of the lowest offer of                 a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content is                 reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low                 offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in                 accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)(1)(i) of this section. See                 evaluation procedures at subpart  25.5.

(c) For end products that are critical items or contain critical           components.         (1)  (i)                If there is a domestic offer                 that is not the low offer, and the restrictions of the Buy American                 statute apply to the low offer, the contracting officer shall                 determine the reasonableness of the cost of the domestic offer by                 adding to the price of the low offer, inclusive of duty—               (A)                   20 percent, plus the                    additional preference factor identified for the critical item                    or end product containing critical components listed at                    section 25.105, if the lowest                    domestic offer is from a large business concern; or                  (B) 30 percent,                   plus the additional preference factor identified for the                   critical item or end product containing critical components                   listed at section 25.105, if the lowest                   domestic offer is from a small business concern. The contracting                   officer shall use this factor, or another factor established in                   agency regulations, in small business set-asides if the low                   offer is from a small business concern offering the product of a                   small business concern that is not a domestic end product (see                     subpart  19.5).  (ii)                The price of the domestic offer                 is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low                 offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in                 accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. See                 evaluation procedures at subpart  25.5.               (2)  (i)                For end products that are not                 COTS items and do not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or                 steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in paragraph                 (c)(1)(ii) of this section result in an unreasonable cost                 determination for the domestic offer or there is no domestic offer                 received, and the low offer is for a foreign end product that does                 not exceed 55 percent domestic content, the contracting officer                 shall—               (A)                   Treat the lowest offer of                    a foreign end product that is manufactured in the United                    States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a domestic                    offer; and                  (B)                   Determine the                    reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the                    evaluation factors listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section                    to the low offer.                  (ii)                The price of the lowest offer of                 a foreign end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content is                 reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low                 offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in                 accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. See                 evaluation procedures at subpart  25.5.               (iii)                The procedures in this paragraph                 (c)(2) will no longer apply as of January 1, 2030.                Subpart 25.2 - Buy American-Construction Materials 25.200 Scope of subpart.  (a)          This subpart implements- (1) 41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American; (2)             Executive Order 10582, December 17, 1954; (3) Executive Order 13881,             July 15, 2019;            (4) Executive Order 14005, January              25, 2021;              and            (5) Waiver of the domestic             content test of the Buy American statute for acquisitions of commercially             available off-the-shelf (COTS) items in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, but             see 25.201(b)(2)(ii). (b)          It applies to contracts for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work in the United States. (c) When using funds appropriated          or otherwise provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub.          L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) for construction, see            subpart  25.6.          25.201 Policy.

(b) The Buy American statute          restricts the purchase of construction materials that are not domestic          construction materials. For manufactured construction materials, the Buy American           statute,  E.O. 13881, and  E.O. 14005           use          a two-part test to define domestic construction materials. (1)                         The article must be manufactured in the United States; and            (2)  (i)                Except for                 construction material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron                 or steel or a combination of both, the cost of domestic components                 must exceed 60 percent of the cost of all the components, except                 that the percentage will be 65 percent for items delivered in                 calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered                 starting in calendar year 2029, but see paragraph (c) of this                 section.                In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, this domestic content test of the                Buy American statute has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items                (see 12.505(a)).  (ii) For construction                material that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a                combination of both, the cost of foreign iron and steel must                constitute less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used                in such construction material (see the definition of "foreign iron and                steel" at 25.003). The cost of foreign                iron and steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron                or steel mill products (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or                sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of the                construction material and a good faith estimate of the cost of all                foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS fasteners. This                domestic content test of the Buy American statute has not been waived                for acquisitions of COTS items in this category, except for COTS                fasteners. (c)  (1)             A contract with a period of              performance that spans the schedule of domestic content threshold              increases specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be              required to comply with each increased threshold for the items in the              year of delivery, unless the senior procurement executive of the              contracting agency allows for application of an alternate domestic              content test for that contract under which the domestic content threshold              in effect at time of contract award will apply to the entire period of              performance for the contract. This authority is not delegable. The senior              procurement executive shall consult the Office of Management and Budget's              Made in America Office before allowing the use of the alternate domestic              content test.            (2)             When a senior procurement executive              allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for a              contract, see 25.1102(a)(3) or (c)(4) for use of              the appropriate Alternate clause to reflect the domestic content              threshold that will apply to the entire period of performance for that              contract.             25.202 Exceptions.  (a) When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting officer may allow the contractor to acquire foreign construction materials without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute: (1) Impracticable or inconsistent with public interest. The head of the agency may determine that application of the restrictions of the Buy American statute to a particular construction material would be impracticable or would be inconsistent with the public interest. The public interest exception applies when an agency has an agreement with a foreign government that provides a blanket exception to the Buy American statute. (2) Nonavailability. The head of the             contracting activity may determine that a particular construction material             is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient             and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.             The determinations of nonavailability of the articles listed at 25.104(a) and             the procedures at 25.103(b)(1)             also apply if any of those articles are acquired as construction materials.              A determination is not              required before January 1, 2030, if there is an offer for a foreign              construction material that exceeds 55 percent domestic content (see 25.204(b)(1)(ii) and 25.204(b)(2)(ii)).            (3) Unreasonable cost. The contracting officer concludes that the cost of domestic construction material is unreasonable in accordance with 25.204. (4) Information technology that is a commercial product. The restriction on purchasing foreign construction material does not apply to the acquisition of information technology that is a commercial product, when using Fiscal Year 2004 or subsequent fiscal year funds (section 535(a) of Division F, Title V, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and similar sections in subsequent appropriations acts). (b) Determination and findings. When a determination is made for any of the reasons stated in this section that certain foreign construction materials may be used, the contracting officer must list the excepted materials in the contract. The agency must make the findings justifying the exception available for public inspection. (c) Acquisitions under trade agreements. For construction contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $7,032,000 or more, see subpart  25.4.  25.203 Preaward determinations.  (a) 						      For any acquisition, an offeror may request from the contracting officer a determination concerning the inapplicability of the Buy American statute for specifically identified construction materials. The time for submitting the request is specified in the solicitation in paragraph (b) of either 52.225-10 or 52.225-12, whichever applies. The information and supporting data that must be included in the request are also specified in the solicitation in paragraphs (c) and (d) of either 52.225-9 or 52.225-11, whichever applies. (b) 						      Before award, the contracting officer must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information.  25.204 Evaluating offers of foreign construction material.  (a)          Offerors proposing to use foreign construction material other than that listed by the Government in the applicable clause at 52.225-9, paragraph (b)(2), or 52.225-11, paragraph (b)(3), or covered by the WTO GPA or a Free Trade Agreement (paragraph (b)(2) of 52.225-11), must provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the respective clauses. (b)  (1) For construction                material that is not a critical item and does not contain critical                components.            (i)                Unless the head of the agency                 specifies a higher percentage, the contracting officer shall add to                 the offered price 20 percent of the cost of any foreign                 construction material proposed for exception from the requirements                 of the Buy American statute based on the unreasonable cost of                 domestic construction materials. In the case of a tie, the                 contracting officer shall give preference to an offer that does not                 include foreign construction material excepted at the request of                 the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.               (ii)                For construction material that                 is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly or predominantly of                 iron or steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in                 paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section result in an unreasonable cost                 determination for the domestic construction material offer or there                 is no domestic construction material offer received, and the low                 offer is for foreign construction material that does not exceed 55                 percent domestic content, the contracting officer shall—               (A)                   Treat the lowest offer of                    foreign construction material that is manufactured in the                    United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a                    domestic offer; and                  (B)                   Determine the                    reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the                    evaluation factor listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) to the low                    offer.                  (iii)                The procedures in paragraph                 (b)(1)(ii) of this section will no longer apply as of January 1,                 2030.               (2) For construction material that is a                critical item or contains critical components.            (i)                The contracting officer shall                 add to the offered price 20 percent, plus the additional preference                 factor identified for the critical item or construction material                 containing critical components listed at section 25.105, of the cost of any foreign construction material                 proposed for exception from the requirements of the Buy American                 statute based on the unreasonable cost of domestic construction                 materials. In the case of a tie, the contracting officer shall give                 preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction                 material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of                 unreasonable cost. See 25.105 for the list of                 critical components and critical items.               (ii)                For construction material that                 is not a COTS item and does not consist wholly or predominantly of                 iron or steel or a combination of both, if the procedures in                 paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section result in an unreasonable cost                 determination for the domestic construction material offer or there                 is no domestic construction material offer received, and the low                 offer is for foreign construction material that does not exceed 55                 percent domestic content, the contracting officer shall—               (A)                   Treat the lowest offer of                    foreign construction material that is manufactured in the                    United States and exceeds 55 percent domestic content as a                    domestic offer; and                  (B)                   Determine the                    reasonableness of the cost of this offer by applying the                    evaluation factors listed in this paragraph (b)(2) to the low                    offer.                  (iii)                The procedures in paragraph                 (b)(2)(ii) of this section will no longer apply as of January 1,                 2030.               (c)          Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible rejection of the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply. (d)          If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(2) of 52.225-9, or paragraph (b)(3) of 52.225-11), the contracting officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract clause.  25.205 Postaward determinations.  (a) 						      If a contractor requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American statute after contract award, the contractor must explain why it could not request the determination before contract award or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the contracting officer concludes that the contractor should have made the request before contract award, the contracting officer may deny the request. (b) 						      The contracting officer must base evaluation of any request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American statute made after contract award on information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the applicable clause at 52.225-9 or 52.225-11 and/or other readily available information. (c) 						      If a determination, under 25.202(a), is made after contract award that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, the contracting officer must negotiate adequate consideration and modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is at least the differential established in 25.202(a) or in accordance with agency procedures.  25.206 Noncompliance. The contracting officer must- (a) 						      Review allegations of Buy American statute violations; (b) 						      Unless fraud is suspected, notify the contractor of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign construction material and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and (c) 						      If the review reveals that a contractor or subcontractor has used foreign construction material without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following: (1) 								        Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of the Buy American statute in accordance with 25.205. (2) 								        Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign construction material. (3) 								        If removal and replacement of foreign construction material incorporated in a building or work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Government, the contracting officer may determine in writing that the foreign construction material need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign construction material does not constitute a determination that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign construction material does not affect the Government’s right to suspend or debar a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier for violation of the Buy American statute, or to exercise other contractual rights and remedies, such as reducing the contract price or terminating the contract for default. (4) 								        If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate contractual remedies, such as terminating the contract for default. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with subpart  9.4. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the officer responsible for criminal investigation.  Subpart 25.3 - Contracts Performed Outside the United States 25.301 Contractor personnel in a designated operational area or supporting a diplomatic or consular mission outside the United States. 25.301-1 Scope.  (a) 						      This section applies to contracts	requiring contractor personnel to perform outside the United States- (1) 								        In	a designated operational area during- (i) 										          Contingency	operations; (ii) 										          Humanitarian	or peacekeeping operations; or (iii) 										          Other	military operations or military exercises, when designated by the	combatant commander; or (2) 								        When supporting	a diplomatic or consular mission- (i) 										          That has been	designated by the Department of State as a danger pay post (see  https://aoprals.state.gov/); or (ii) 										          That the	contracting officer determines is a post at which application of	the clause at FAR 52.225-19,	Contractor Personnel in a Designated Operational Area or Supporting	a Diplomatic or Consular Mission outside the United States, is appropriate. (b) 						      Any of	the types of operations listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section	may include stability operations such as- (1) 								        Establishment	or maintenance of a safe and secure environment; or (2) 								        Provision	of emergency infrastructure reconstruction, humanitarian relief,	or essential governmental services (until feasible to transition	to local government). (c) 						      This section	does not apply to personal services contracts (see FAR 37.104), unless specified	otherwise in agency procedures.  25.301-2 Government support.  (a) 						      Generally, contractors are responsible for providing their own logistical and security support, including logistical and security support for their employees. The agency shall provide logistical or security support only when the appropriate agency official, in accordance with agency guidance, determines that- (1) 								        Such Government support is available and is needed to ensure continuation of essential contractor services; and (2) 								        The contractor cannot obtain adequate support from other sources at a reasonable cost. (b) 						      The contracting officer shall specify in the contract, and in the solicitation if possible, the exact support to be provided, and whether this support is provided on a reimbursable basis, citing the authority for the reimbursement.  25.301-3 Weapons. The contracting officer shall follow agency procedures and the weapons policy established by the combatant commander or the chief of mission when authorizing contractor personnel to carry weapons (see paragraph (i) of the clause at 52.225-19, Contractor Personnel in a Designated Operational Area or Supporting a Diplomatic or Consular Mission outside the United States).  25.301-4 Contract clause. Insert the clause at 52.225-19, Contractor	Personnel in a Designated Operational Area or Supporting a Diplomatic	or Consular Mission outside the United States, in solicitations	and contracts, other than personal service contracts with individuals,	that will require contractor personnel to perform outside the United	States— (a) 						      In	a designated operational area during– (1) 								        Contingency	operations; (2) 								        Humanitarian	or peacekeeping operations; or (3) 								        Other military	operations or military exercises, when designated by the combatant	commander; or (b) 						      When supporting	a diplomatic or consular mission– (1) 								        That has been	designated by the Department of State as a danger pay post (see  https://aoprals.state.gov/); or (2) 								        That the	contracting officer determines is a post at which application of	the clause FAR 52.225-19,	Contractor Personnel in a Designated Operational Area or Supporting	a Diplomatic or Consular Mission outside the United States, is appropriate.  25.302 Contractors performing private security functions outside the United States. 25.302-1 Scope. This section prescribes policy for implementing section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 (Pub. L. 110-181), as amended by section 853 of the NDAA for FY 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417), and sections 831 and 832 of the NDAA for FY 2011 (Pub. L. 111-383) (see 10 U.S.C. Subtitle A, Part V, Subpart G Note).       25.302-2 Definitions. As used in this section- Area of combat operations means an area of operations designated as such by the Secretary of Defense when enhanced coordination of contractors performing private security functions working for Government agencies is required. Other significant military operations means activities, other than combat operations, as part of a contingency operation outside the United States that is carried out by United States Armed Forces in an uncontrolled or unpredictable high-threat environment where personnel performing security functions may be called upon to use deadly force (see 25.302-3(a)(2)). Private security functions means activities engaged in by a contractor, as follows-                                          (1) Guarding of personnel, facilities, designated sites, or property of a Federal agency, the contractor or subcontractor, or a third party; or (2) Any other activity for which personnel are required to carry weapons in the performance of their duties in accordance with the terms of the contract.  25.302-3 Applicability.  (a) 						      This section applies to contracts that require performance outside the United States- (1) 								        In an area of combat operations as designated by the Secretary of Defense; or (2) 								        In an area of other significant military operations as designated by the Secretary of Defense, and only upon agreement of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. (b) 						      These designations can	be found at  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/designated_areas_of_other_significant_military_operations.html and  http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/designated_areas_of_combat_operations.html. (c) 						      When the applicability requirements of this subsection are met, contractors and subcontractors must comply with 32 CFR part 159, whether the contract is for the performance of private security functions as a primary deliverable or the provision of private security functions is ancillary to the stated deliverables. (d) 						      The requirements of section 25.302 shall not apply to- (1) 								        Contracts entered into by elements of the intelligence community in support of intelligence activities; or (2) 								        Temporary arrangements entered into on a non-DoD contract for the performance of private security functions by individual indigenous personnel not affiliated with a local or expatriate security company. These temporary arrangements must still comply with local law.  25.302-4 Policy.  (a) General.  (1) 								        The policy, responsibilities, procedures, accountability, training, equipping, and conduct of personnel performing private security functions in designated areas are addressed at 32 CFR part 159, entitled "Private Security Contractors Operating in Contingency Operations". Contractor responsibilities include ensuring that employees are aware of, and comply with, relevant orders, directives, and instructions; keeping appropriate personnel records; accounting for weapons; registering and identifying armored vehicles, helicopters, and other military vehicles; and reporting specified incidents in which personnel performing private security functions under a contract are involved. (2) 								        In addition, contractors are required to fully cooperate with any Government-authorized investigation into incidents reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of the clause at 52.225-26, Contractors Performing Private Security Functions Outside the United States, by providing access to employees performing private security functions and relevant information in the possession of the contractor regarding the incident concerned. (b) Implementing guidance. In accordance with 32 CFR part 159- (1) 								        Geographic combatant commanders will provide DoD contractors performing private security functions with guidance and procedures for the operational environment in their area of responsibility; and (2) 								        In a designated area of combat operations, or areas of other significant military operations, as designated by the Secretary of Defense and only upon agreement of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, the relevant Chief of Mission will provide implementing instructions for non-DoD contractors performing private security functions and their personnel consistent with the standards set forth by the geographic combatant commander. In accordance with 32 CFR 159.4(c), the Chief of Mission has the option of instructing non-DoD contractors performing private security functions and their personnel to follow the guidance and procedures of the geographic combatant commander and/or a sub-unified commander or joint force commander where specifically authorized by the combatant commander to do so and notice of that authorization is provided to non-DoD agencies.  25.302-5 Remedies.  (a) 						      In addition to other remedies available to the Government- (1) 								        The contracting officer may direct the contractor, at its own expense, to remove and replace any contractor or subcontractor personnel performing private security functions who fail to comply with or violate applicable requirements. Such action may be taken at the Government's discretion without prejudice to its rights under any other contract provision, e.g., termination for default; (2) 								        The contracting officer shall include the contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this section in appropriate databases of past performance and consider any such failure in any responsibility determination or evaluation of past performance; and (3) 								        In the case of award-fee contracts, the contracting officer shall consider a contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection in the evaluation of the contractor’s performance during the relevant evaluation period, and may treat such failure as a basis for reducing or denying award fees for such period or for recovering all or part of award fees previously paid for such period. (b) 						      If the performance failures are severe, prolonged, or repeated, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the appropriate suspending and debarring official.  25.302-6 Contract clause.  (a) 						      Use the clause at 52.225-26, Contractors Performing Private Security Functions Outside the United States, in solicitations and contracts for performance outside the United States in an area of- (1) 								        Combat operations, as designated by the Secretary of Defense; or (2) 								        Other significant military operations, as designated by the Secretary of Defense and only upon agreement of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. (b) 						      The clause is not required to be used for- (1) 								        Contracts entered into by elements of the intelligence community in support of intelligence activities; or (2) 								        Temporary arrangements entered into by non-DoD contractors for the performance of private security functions by individual indigenous personnel not affiliated with a local or expatriate security company.  Subpart 25.4 - Trade Agreements 25.400 Scope of subpart.  (a) 						      This subpart provides policies and procedures applicable to acquisitions that are covered by- (1) 								        The World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement (WTO GPA), as approved by Congress in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Public Law 103-465); (2) 								        Free Trade Agreements (FTA), consisting of- (i)                USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as approved by Congress in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (Government Procurement Agreement applicable only to the United States and Mexico) ( Pub.

(a)  (1) The Trade Agreements Act ( 19 U.S.C.2501, et seq.) provides the authority for the President to waive the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products from countries that have signed an international trade agreement with the United States, or that meet certain other criteria, such as being a least developed country. The President has delegated this waiver authority to the U.S. Trade Representative. In acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, Free Trade Agreements, or the Israeli Trade Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has waived the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products. Offers of eligible products receive equal consideration with domestic offers. (2) The contracting officer shall determine the origin of services by the country in which the firm providing the services is established. See subpart  25.5 for evaluation procedures for supply contracts covered by trade agreements. (b) The value of the acquisition is a determining factor in the applicability of trade agreements. Most of these dollar thresholds are subject to revision by the U.S. Trade Representative approximately every 2 years. The various thresholds are summarized as follows: Table 1 to Paragraph (b)Trade Agreement              Supply Contract (equal to or exceeding)            Service Contract (equal to or exceeding) Construction Contract (equal to or exceeding) WTO GPA $183,000 $183,000 $7,032,000              FTAs                          Australia FTA            92,319 92,319 7,032,000              Bahrain FTA            183,000 183,000 12,001,460              CAFTA-DR (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua)            92,319 92,319 7,032,000              Chile FTA            92,319 92,319 7,032,000              Colombia FTA            92,319 92,319 7,032,000              Korea FTA            100,000 100,000 7,032,000              Morocco FTA            183,000 183,000 7,032,000             USMCA                          -Mexico            92,319 92,319 12,001,460              Oman FTA            183,000 183,000 12,001,460              Panama FTA            183,000 183,000 7,032,000              Peru FTA            183,000 183,000 7,032,000              Singapore FTA            92,319 92,319 7,032,000              Israeli Trade Act            50,000 - -  25.403 World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  (a) 						      Eligible products from WTO GPA and FTA countries are entitled to the nondiscriminatory treatment specified in 25.402(a)(1). The WTO GPA and FTAs specify procurement procedures designed to ensure fairness (see 25.408). (b) Thresholds.  (1) 								        To determine whether the acquisition of products by lease, rental, or lease-purchase contract (including lease-to-ownership, or lease-with-option-to purchase) is covered by the WTO GPA or an FTA, calculate the estimated acquisition value as follows: (i) 										          If a fixed-term contract of 12 months or less is contemplated, use the total estimated value of the acquisition. (ii) 										          If a fixed-term contract of more than 12 months is contemplated, use the total estimated value of the acquisition plus the estimated residual value of the leased equipment at the conclusion of the contemplated term of the contract. (iii) 										          If an indefinite-term contract is contemplated, use the estimated monthly payment multiplied by the total number of months that ordering would be possible under the proposed contract, i.e., the initial ordering period plus any optional ordering periods. (iv) 										          If there is any doubt as to the contemplated term of the contract, use the estimated monthly payment multiplied by 48. (2) 								        The estimated value includes the value of all options. (3) 								        If, in any 12-month period, recurring or multiple awards for the same type of product or products are anticipated, use the total estimated value of these projected awards to determine whether the WTO GPA or an FTA applies. Do not divide any acquisition with the intent of reducing the estimated value of the acquisition below the dollar threshold of the WTO GPA or an FTA. (c) Purchase restriction.  (1) 								        Under the Trade Agreements Act ( 19 U.S.C. 2512), in acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, acquire only U.S.-made or designated country end products or U.S. or designated country services, unless offers for such end products or services are either not received or are insufficient to fulfill the requirements. This purchase restriction does not apply below the WTO GPA threshold for supplies and services, even if the acquisition is covered by an FTA. (2) 								        This restriction does not apply to purchases of supplies by the Department of Defense from a country with which it has entered into a reciprocal agreement, as provided in departmental regulations.  25.404 Least developed countries. For acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, least developed country end products, construction material, and services must be treated as eligible products.  25.405 Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative. Under the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative, the United States Trade Representative has determined that, for acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, Caribbean Basin country end products, construction material, and services must be treated as eligible products. In accordance with Section 201 (a)(3) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Implementation Act (Pub. L. 109-53) (19 U.S.C. 4031), when the CAFTA-DR agreement enters into force with respect to a country, that country is no longer designated as a beneficiary country for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, and is therefore no longer included in the definition of "Caribbean Basin country" for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative.  25.406 Israeli Trade Act. Acquisitions of supplies by most agencies are covered by the Israeli Trade Act, if the estimated value of the acquisition is $50,000 or more but does not exceed the WTO GPA threshold for supplies (see 25.402(b)). Agencies other than the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and the Office of Thrift Supervision must evaluate offers of Israeli end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Israeli Trade Act does not prohibit the purchase of other foreign end products.  25.407 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Under the authority of Section 303 of the Trade Agreements Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has waived the Buy American statute for civil aircraft and related articles that meet the substantial transformation test of the Trade Agreements Act, from countries that are parties to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Those countries are Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macao China, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (Chinese Taipei), and the United Kingdom.  25.408 Procedures.  (a) 						      If the WTO GPA or an FTA applies (see 25.401), the contracting officer must- (1) 								        Comply with the requirements of 5.203, Publicizing and response time; (2) 								        Comply with the requirements of 5.207, Preparation and transmittal of synopses; (3) 								        Not include technical requirements in solicitations solely to preclude the acquisition of eligible products; (4) 								        Specify in solicitations that offerors must submit offers in the English language and in U.S. dollars (see 52.214-34, Submission of Offers in the English Language, and 52.214-35, Submission of Offers in U.S. Currency, or paragraph (c)(5) of 52.215-1, Instruction to Offerors-Competitive Acquisitions); and (5) 								        Provide unsuccessful offerors from WTO GPA or FTA countries notice in accordance with 14.409-1 or 15.503. (b) 						      See subpart  25.5 for evaluation procedures and examples.  Subpart 25.5 - Evaluating Foreign Offers-Supply Contracts 25.501 General. The contracting officer- (a) 						      Must apply the evaluation procedures of this subpart to each line item of an offer unless either the offer or the solicitation specifies evaluation on a group basis (see 25.503); (b) 						      May rely on the offeror’s certification of end product origin when evaluating a foreign offer; (c) Must identify and reject          offers of end products that are prohibited in accordance with            subpart  25.7;          and (d)          When trade agreements are           involved,           must          not use the Buy American statute evaluation factors prescribed in this subpart to          provide a preference for one foreign offer over another foreign offer.  25.502 Application.  (a) 						      Unless otherwise specified in agency regulations, perform the following steps in the order presented: (1) 								        Eliminate all offers or offerors that are unacceptable for reasons other than price; e.g., nonresponsive, debarred or suspended, or a prohibited source (see subpart  25.7). (2) 								        Rank the remaining offers by price. (3) 								        If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors as specified in this section and use the evaluated cost or price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government. (b) 						      For acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA (see subpart  25.4)- (1) 								        Consider only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products, unless no offers of such end products were received; (2) 								        If the agency gives the same consideration given eligible offers to offers of U.S.-made end products that are not domestic end products, award on the low offer. Otherwise, evaluate in accordance with agency procedures; and (3) 								        If there were no offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products, make a nonavailability determination (see 25.103(b)(2)) and award on the low offer (see 25.403(c)). (c) 						      For acquisitions not covered by the WTO GPA, but subject to the Buy American statute (an FTA or the Israeli Trade Act also may apply), the following applies: (1)             If the low offer is a domestic offer or an eligible offer under              an FTA or the Israeli Trade Act, award on that offer.            (2)             If the low offer is a              noneligible offer and there were no domestic offers (see 25.103(b)(3)), award on the low offer. The procedures at 25.106(b)(2) and 25.106(c)(2) do not              apply.            (3)             If the low offer is a              noneligible offer and there is an eligible offer that is lower than the              lowest domestic offer, award on the low offer. The procedures at 25.106(b)(2) and 25.106(c)(2) do not              apply.            (4)             Otherwise, apply the              appropriate evaluation factor provided in 25.106 to the low offer. The procedures at 25.106(b)(2) and 25.106(c)(2) do not              apply.            (d) Ties.  (1) 								        If application of an evaluation factor results in a tie between a domestic offer and a foreign offer, award on the domestic offer. (2) 								        If no evaluation preference was applied (i.e., offers afforded nondiscriminatory treatment under the Buy American statute), resolve ties between domestic and foreign offers by a witnessed drawing of lots by an impartial individual. (3) 								        Resolve ties between foreign offers from small business concerns (under the Buy American statute, a small business offering a manufactured article that does not meet the definition of "domestic end product" is a foreign offer) or foreign offers from a small business concern and a large business concern in accordance with 14.408-6(a).  25.503 Group offers.  (a)          						      If the solicitation or an offer specifies that award can be made only on a group of line items or on all line items contained in the solicitation or offer, reject the offer- (1) If any part of the award             would consist of prohibited end products (see subpart  25.7);             or (2)             								        If the acquisition is covered by the WTO GPA and any part of the offer consists of items restricted in accordance with 25.403(c). (b)          						      If an offer restricts award to a group of line items or to all line items contained in the offer, determine for each line item whether to apply an evaluation factor (see 25.504-4, Example 1). (1)             								        First, evaluate offers that do not specify an award restriction on a line item basis in accordance with 25.502, determining a tentative award pattern by selecting for each line item the offer with the lowest evaluated price. (2)             								        Evaluate an offer that specifies an award restriction against the offered prices of the tentative award pattern, applying the appropriate evaluation factor on a line item basis. (3)             								        Compute the total evaluated price for the tentative award pattern and the offer that specified an award restriction. (4)             								        Unless the total evaluated price of the offer that specified an award restriction is less than the total evaluated price of the tentative award pattern, award based on the tentative award pattern. (c)          						      If the solicitation specifies that award will be made only on a group of line items or all line items contained in the solicitation, determine the category of end products on the basis of each line item, but determine whether to apply an evaluation factor on the basis of the group of items (see 25.504-4, Example 2). (1)             								        If the proposed price of domestic end products exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group, evaluate the entire group as a domestic offer. Evaluate all other groups as foreign offers. (2)             								        For foreign offers, if the proposed price of domestic end products and eligible products exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group, evaluate the entire group as an eligible offer. (3)             								        Apply the evaluation factor to the entire group in accordance with 25.502. (d)          If no trade agreement applies to a           solicitation and the solicitation specifies that award will be made only on a           group of line items or all line items contained in the solicitation, determine           the category of end products ( i.e., domestic or foreign) on the basis           of each line item, but determine whether to apply an evaluation factor on the           basis of the group of items ( see 25.504-4(c), Example           3).         (1)             If the proposed price of domestic end              products exceeds 50 percent of the total proposed price of the group,              evaluate the entire group as a domestic offer. Evaluate all other groups              as foreign offers.            (2)             Apply the evaluation factor to the              entire group in accordance with 25.502, except where 25.502(c)(4) applies and the evaluated price of the low offer              remains less than the lowest domestic offer. Where the evaluated price of              the low offer remains less than the lowest domestic offer, treat as a              domestic offer any group where the proposed price of end products with a              domestic content of at least 55 percent exceeds 50 percent of the total              proposed price of the group.            (3)             Apply the evaluation factor to the              entire group in accordance with 25.502(c)(4).             25.504 Evaluation examples. The following examples illustrate the application of the evaluation procedures in 25.502 and 25.503. The examples assume that the contracting officer has eliminated all offers that are unacceptable for reasons other than price or a trade agreement (see 25.502(a)(1)). The evaluation factor may change as provided in agency regulations.  25.504-1 Buy American statute.  (a)  (1) Example              1.            Offer A                    $16,000                  Domestic end product, small business Offer B                    $15,700                  Domestic end product, small business                   Offer                    C                                      $10,100                                      U.S.-made                    end product (not domestic), small business                   (2) Analysis: This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $50,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offer C is of 50 percent domestic content, therefore Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product, because it is the product of a small business but is not a domestic end product ( see 25.502(c)(4)). Since Offer B is a domestic offer, apply the 30 percent factor to Offer C ( see 25.106(b)(2)). The resulting evaluated price of $13,130 remains lower than Offer B. The cost of Offer B is therefore unreasonable ( see 25.106(b)(1)(ii)). The 25.106(b)(2) procedures do not apply. Award on Offer C at $10,100 ( see 25.502(c)(4)(i)).  (b)  (1) Example 2. Offer A $11,000 Domestic end product, small business Offer B $10,700 Domestic end product, small business Offer C $10,200 U.S.-made end product (not domestic), small business  (2) Analysis: This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product because it is the product of a small business but is not a domestic end product (see 25.502(c)(4)). After applying the 30 percent factor, the evaluated price of Offer C is $13,260. Award on Offer B at $10,700 (see 25.502(c)(4)(ii)). (c)  (1) Example 3.            Offer A $14,000 Domestic end product (complies with the required                   domestic content), small business. Offer B 12,500 U.S.-made end product (not domestic, exceeds 55%                   domestic content), small business. Offer C 10,100 U.S.-made end product (not domestic, with less                   than 55% domestic content), small business.  (2) Analysis. This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $50,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offers B and C are initially evaluated as foreign end products, because they are the products of small businesses but are not domestic end products ( see 25.502(c)(4)). Offer C is the low offer. After applying the 30 percent factor, the evaluated price of Offer C is $13,130. The resulting evaluated price of $13,130 remains lower than Offer A. The cost of Offer A is therefore unreasonable. Offer B is then treated as a domestic offer, because it is for a U.S.-made end product that exceeds 55 percent domestic content ( see 25.106(b)(2)). Offer B is determined reasonable because it is lower than the $13,130 evaluated price of Offer C. Award on Offer B at $12,500.  25.504-2 WTO GPA/Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative/FTAs.  Example 1. Offer A $304,000 U.S.-made end product (not domestic) Offer B $303,000 U.S.-made end product (domestic), small business Offer C $300,000 Eligible product Offer D $295,000 Noneligible product (not U.S.-made)  Analysis: Eliminate Offer D because the acquisition is covered by the WTO GPA and there is an offer of a U.S.-made or an eligible product (see 25.502(b)(1)). If the agency gives the same consideration given eligible offers to offers of U.S.-made end products that are not domestic offers, it is unnecessary to determine if U.S.-made end products are domestic (large or small business). No further analysis is necessary. Award on the low remaining offer, Offer C (see 25.502(b)(2)).  25.504-3 FTA/Israeli Trade Act.  (a) Example 1. Offer A $105,000 Domestic end product, small business                 Offer B               $100,000 Eligible product  Analysis: Since the low offer is an eligible offer, award on the low offer (see 25.502(c)(1)). (b) Example 2. Offer A $105,000 Eligible product                 Offer B               $103,000 Noneligible product  Analysis: Since the acquisition is not covered by the WTO GPA, the contracting officer can consider the noneligible offer. Since no domestic offer was received, make a nonavailability determination and award on Offer B (see 25.502(c)(2)). (c) Example 3. Offer A $105,000 Domestic end product, large business                 Offer B               $103,000 Eligible product                 Offer C               $100,000 Noneligible product  Analysis: Since the acquisition is not covered by the WTO GPA, the contracting officer can consider the noneligible offer. Because the eligible offer (Offer B) is lower than the domestic offer (Offer A), no evaluation factor applies to the low offer (Offer C). Award on the low offer (see 25.502(c)(3)).  25.504-4 Group award basis.  (a) Example 1. OFFERS Item A B C 1 DO = $55,000 EL = $56,000 NEL = $50,000 2 NEL =                 $13,000 EL =                 $10,000 EL =                 $13,000 3 NEL =                 $11,500 DO =                 $12,000 DO =                 $10,000 4 NEL =                 $24,000 EL =                 $28,000 NEL =                 $22,000 5 DO =                  $18,000 NEL =                  $10,000 DO =                  $14,000   $121,500 $116,000 $109,000  Key:     DO = Domestic end product EL = Eligible product NEL = Noneligible product  Problem: Offeror C specifies all-or-none award. Assume all offerors are large businesses. The acquisition is not covered by the WTO GPA. Analysis: (see 25.503) STEP 1: Evaluate Offers A & B before considering Offer C and determine which offer has the lowest evaluated cost for each line item (the tentative award pattern): Item 1: Low offer A is domestic; select A. Item 2: Low offer B is eligible; do not apply factor; select B. Item 3: Low offer A is noneligible and Offer B is a domestic offer. Apply a 20 percent factor to Offer A. The evaluated price of Offer A is higher than Offer B; select B. Item 4: Low offer A is noneligible. Since neither offer is a domestic offer, no evaluation factor applies; select A. Item 5: Low offer B is noneligible; apply a 20 percent factor to Offer B. Offer A is still higher than Offer B; select B. STEP 2: Evaluate Offer C against the tentative award pattern for Offers A and B: OFFERS Item Low Offer Tentative Award Pattern from A and B C 1  A DO = $ 55,000 *NEL =                 $60,000               2  B EL = $10,000 EL =                 $13,000               3  B DO = $12,000 DO =                 $10,000               4  A NEL = $24,000 NEL =                 $22,000               5  B *NEL =                  $12,000                 DO = $14,000                 TOTAL                $113,000 $119,000 *Offer + 20 percent.          On a line item basis, apply a factor to any noneligible offer if the other offer for that line item is domestic.                  For Item 1, apply a factor to Offer C because Offer A is domestic and the acquisition was not covered by the WTO GPA. The evaluated price of Offer C, Item 1, becomes $60,000 ($50,000 plus 20 percent). Apply a factor to Offer B, Item 5, because it is a noneligible product and Offer C is domestic. The evaluated price of Offer B is $12,000 ($10,000 plus 20 percent). Evaluate the remaining items without applying a factor.                  STEP 3: The tentative unrestricted award pattern from Offers A and B is lower than the evaluated price of Offer C. Award the combination of Offers A and B. Note that if Offer C had not specified all-or-none award, award would be made on Offer C for line items 3 and 4, totaling an award of $32,000.         (b) Example 2. OFFERS Item A B C 1 DO = $50,000 EL = $50,500 NEL = $50,000 2 NEL = $10,300 NEL = $10,000 EL = $10,200 3 EL = $20,400 EL = $21,000 NEL = $20,200 4 DO = $10,500 DO = $10,300 DO = $10,400  TOTAL $91,200 $91,800 $90,800  Problem: The solicitation specifies award on a group basis. Assume the Buy American statute applies and the acquisition cannot be set aside for small business concerns. All offerors are large businesses. Analysis: (see 25.503(c))          STEP 1: Determine which of the offers are domestic (see 25.503(c)(1)):         Domestic [percent] Determination A                   $50,000 (Offer A1) + $10,500 (Offer A4) = $60,500                                 $60,500/$91,200 (Offer A Total) = 66.3%                 Domestic  B                   $10,300 (Offer B4) /$91,800 (Offer B Total) $ = 11.2%  Foreign  C                   $10,400 (Offer C4) /$90,800 (Offer C Total) = 11.5%  Foreign  STEP 2: Determine whether foreign offers are eligible or noneligible offers (see 25.503(c)(2)): Domestic + Eligible [percent] Determination A                   N/A (Both Domestic)                 Domestic  B                   $50,500 (Offer B1) + $21,000 (Offer B3) + $10,300 (Offer B4)= $81,800.                                 $81,800 /$91,800 (Offer B Total) = 89.1%                 Eligible  C                   $10,200 (Offer C2) + $10,400 (Offer C4) = $20,600.                                  $20,600/$90,800 (Offer C Total) = 22.7%  Noneligible  STEP 3: Determine whether to apply an evaluation factor (see 25.503(c)(3)). The low offer (Offer C) is a foreign offer. There is no          eligible offer lower than the domestic offer. Therefore, apply the factor to the          low offer. Addition of the 20 percent factor (use 30 percent if Offer A is a small          business) to Offer C yields an evaluated price of $108,960 ($90,800 + 20 percent).          Award on Offer A (see 25.502(c)(4)(ii)). Note that, if Offer A          were greater than Offer B, an evaluation factor would not be applied, and award          would be on Offer C (see 25.502(c)(3)).  (c) Example           3.         OFFERS Item A B C 1 DO = $17,800 FO (>55%) = $16,000 FO (>55%) = $11,200 2 FO (>55%) = $9,000 FO (>55%) = $8,500 DO = $10,200 3 FO (>55%) = $11,200 FO (>55%) = $12,000 FO (>55%) = $11,000 4 DO = $10,000 DO = $9,000 FO (>55%) = $6,400 Total $48,000 $45,500 $38,800.  Key: DO = Domestic end product (complies with the          required domestic content). FO > 55% = Foreign end product with domestic          content exceeding 55%. FO < 55% = Foreign end product with domestic          content of 55% or less. Problem: The solicitation specifies          award on a group basis. Assume only the Buy American statute applies (           i.e., no trade agreements apply) and the acquisition cannot be set aside          for small business concerns. All offerors are large businesses.  Analysis: (see 25.503(d))  STEP 1: Determine which of the offers          are domestic (see 25.503(d)(1)). Domestic [percent] Determination A  $17,800 (Offer A1) + $10,000 (Offer A4) =                 $27,800  $27,800/$48,000 (Offer A Total) = 58%  Domestic  B  $9,000 (Offer B4)/$45,500 (Offer B Total) =                 19.8%  Foreign  C  $10,200 (Offer C2)/$38,800 (Offer C Total) =                 26.3%  Foreign   STEP 2: Determine which offer,           domestic or foreign, is the low offer. If the low offer is a foreign offer,           apply the evaluation factor (see 25.503(d)(2)). The low offer (Offer C) is a           foreign offer. Therefore, apply the factor to the low offer. Addition of the 20           percent factor (use 30 percent if Offer A is a small business) to Offer C           yields an evaluated price of $46,560 ($38,800 + 20 percent). Offer C remains           the low offer.  STEP 3: Determine if there is a foreign          offer that could be treated as a domestic offer (see 25.106(b)(2)          and 25.503(d)(2)). Amount of domestic content (percent) Determination A  N/A  N/A  B  $9,000 (Offer B4)/$45,500 (Offer B Total) $ =                 19.8% is domestic AND $16,000 (Offer B1) + $8,500 (Offer B2) + $12,000                 (Offer B3) = $36,500 $36,500/$45,500 (Offer B Total) = 80.2% can be treated as                 domestic 19.8% + 80.2% = 100% is domestic or can be treated as domestic  Can be treated as domestic.  C $10,200 (Offer C2)/$38,800 (Offer C Total) = 26.3% is                domestic Noneligible  STEP 4: If there is a foreign offer that          could be treated as a domestic offer, compare the evaluated price of the low offer          to the price of the offer treated as domestic ( see 25.503(d)(3)). Offer B can be treated as a domestic offer ($45,500). The          evaluated price of the low offer (Offer C) is $46,560. Award on Offer B.  Subpart 25.6 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Buy American statute-Construction Materials 25.600 Scope of subpart. This subpart implements section 1605 in Division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) with regard to manufactured construction material and the  41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American (referred to in this subpart as the Buy American statute) with regard to unmanufactured construction material. It applies to construction projects that use funds appropriated or otherwise provided by the Recovery Act.  25.601 Definitions. As used in this subpart- Domestic construction material means the following:                                          (1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States. (The Buy American statute applies.) (2) A manufactured construction material that is manufactured in the United States and, if the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel was produced in the United States. (Section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies.) Foreign construction material means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. Manufactured construction material means any construction material that is not unmanufactured construction material. Public building or public work means a building or work, the construction, prosecution, completion, or repair of which is carried on directly or indirectly by authority of, or with funds of, a Federal agency to serve the interest of the general public regardless of whether title thereof is in a Federal agency (see 22.401). These buildings and works may include, without limitation, bridges, dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers, mains, power lines, pumping stations, heavy generators, railways, airports, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys, jetties, breakwaters, levees, and canals, and the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of such buildings and works. Recovery Act designated country means a World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement country, a Free Trade Agreement country, or a least developed country.  Unmanufactured construction material means raw material brought to the construction site for incorporation into the building or work that has not been-                                          (1) Processed into a specific form and shape; or (2) Combined with other raw material to create a material that has different properties than the properties of the individual raw materials.  25.602 Policy. 25.602-1 Section 1605 of the Recovery Act. Except as provided in 25.603- (a) 						      None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the Recovery Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work unless the public building or public work is located in the United States and- (1) 								        All of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used as construction material in the project are produced or manufactured in the United States. (i) 										          All manufactured construction material must be manufactured in the United States. (ii) Iron or steel components. (A) 												            Iron or steel components of construction material consisting wholly or predominantly of iron or steel must be produced in the United States. This does not restrict the origin of the elements of the iron or steel, but requires that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. (B) 												            The requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to iron or steel components or subcomponents in construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel. (iii) All other components. There is no restriction on the origin or place of production or manufacture of components or subcomponents that do not consist of iron or steel. (iv) Examples. (A) 												            If a steel guardrail consists predominantly of steel, even though coated with aluminum, then the steel would be subject to the section 1605 restriction requiring that all stages of production of the steel occur in the United States, in addition to the requirement to manufacture the guardrail in the United States. There would be no restrictions on the other components of the guardrail. (B) 												            If a wooden window frame is delivered to the site as a single construction material, there is no restriction on any of the components, including the steel lock on the window frame; or (2) 								        If trade agreements apply, the manufactured construction material shall either comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection, or be wholly the product of or be substantially transformed in a Recovery Act designated country; (b) 						      Manufactured materials purchased directly by the Government and delivered to the site for incorporation into the project shall meet the same domestic source requirements as specified for manufactured construction material in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; and (c) 						      A project may include several contracts, a single contract, or one or more line items on a contract.  25.602-2 Buy American statute Except as provided in 25.603, use only unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States, as required by the Buy American statute or, if trade agreements apply, unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in a designated country may also be used.  25.603 Exceptions.  (a)  (1) When one of the following exceptions applies, the contracting officer may allow the contractor to incorporate foreign manufactured construction materials without regard to the restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or foreign unmanufactured construction material without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute: (i) Nonavailability. The head of the contracting activity may determine that a particular construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. The determinations of nonavailability of the articles listed at 25.104(a) and the procedures at 25.103(b)(1) also apply if any of those articles are acquired as construction materials. (ii) Unreasonable cost. The contracting officer concludes that the cost of domestic construction material is unreasonable in accordance with 25.605. (iii) Inconsistent with public interest. The head of the agency may determine that application of the restrictions of section 1605 of the Recovery Act to a particular manufactured construction material, or the restrictions of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured construction material would be inconsistent with the public interest. (2) In addition, the head of the agency may determine that application of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured construction material would be impracticable. (b) Determinations. When a determination is made, for any of the reasons stated in this section, that certain foreign construction materials may be used- (1) The contracting officer shall list the excepted materials in the contract; and (2) For determinations with regard to the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act, unless the construction material has already been determined to be domestically nonavailable (see list at 25.104), the head of the agency shall provide a notice to the Federal Register within three business days after the determination is made, with a copy to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy and to the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. The notice shall include- (i) The title "Buy American Exception under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"; (ii) The dollar value and brief description of the project; and (iii) A detailed justification as to why the restriction is being waived. (c) Acquisitions under trade agreements. (1) For construction contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $7,032,000 or more, also see subpart 25.4. Offers proposing the use of construction material from a designated country shall receive equal consideration with offers proposing the use of domestic construction material. (2) For purposes of applying section 1605 of the Recovery Act to evaluation of manufactured construction material, designated countries do not include the Caribbean Basin Countries.  25.604 Preaward determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute.  (a) For any acquisition, an offeror may request from the contracting officer a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute for specifically identified construction materials. The time for submitting the request is specified in the solicitation in paragraph (b) of either 52.225-22 or 52.225-24, whichever applies. The information and supporting data that must be included in the request are also specified in the solicitation in paragraphs (c) and (d) of either 52.225-21 or 52.225-23, whichever applies. (b) Before award, the contracting officer must evaluate all requests based on the information provided and may supplement this information with other readily available information. (c) Determination based on unreasonable cost of domestic construction material. (1) Manufactured construction material. The contracting officer must compare the offered price of the contract using foreign manufactured construction material (i.e., any construction material not manufactured in the United States, or construction material consisting predominantly of iron or steel and the iron or steel is not produced in the United States) to the estimated price if all domestic manufactured construction material were used. If use of domestic manufactured construction material would increase the overall offered price of the contract by more than 25 percent, then the contracting officer shall determine that the cost of the domestic manufactured construction material is unreasonable (2) Unmanufactured construction material. The contracting officer must compare the cost of each foreign unmanufactured construction material to the cost of domestic unmanufactured construction material. If the cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material exceeds the cost of the foreign unmanufactured construction material by more than 20 percent, then the contracting officer shall determine that the cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material is unreasonable.  25.605 Evaluating offers of foreign construction material.  (a) If the contracting officer has determined that an exception applies because the cost of certain domestic construction material is unreasonable, in accordance with section 25.604, then the contracting officer shall apply evaluation factors to the offer incorporating the use of such foreign construction material as follows: (1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total offered price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction material is incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic construction material requested by the offeror. (2) In addition, use an evaluation factor of 20 percent applied to the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured construction material requested by the offeror. (3) Total evaluated price = offered price + (.25 x offered price, if (a)(1) applies) + (.20 x cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material, if (a)(2) applies). (b) If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and use the evaluated price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government (c) Unless paragraph (b) applies, if two or more offers are equal in price, the contracting officer must give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost. (d) Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible rejection of the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply. (e) If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(3) of 52.225-21, or paragraph (b)(3) of 52.225-23), the contracting officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract clause.  25.606 Postaward determinations.  (a) 						      If a contractor requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute after contract award, the contractor must explain why it could not request the determination before contract award or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the contracting officer concludes that the contractor should have made the request before contract award, the contracting officer may deny the request. (b) 						      The contracting officer must base evaluation of any request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute made after contract award on information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the applicable clause at 52.225-21 or 52.225-23 and/or other readily available information. (c) 						      If a determination, under 25.603(a), is made after contract award that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or to the Buy American statute applies, the contracting officer must negotiate adequate consideration and modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is at least the differential established in 25.605(a).  25.607 Noncompliance. The contracting officer must- (a) 						      Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or Buy American statute; (b) 						      Unless fraud is suspected, notify the contractor of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign construction material and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and (c) 						      If the review reveals that a contractor or subcontractor has used foreign construction material without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following: (1) 								        Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute in accordance with 25.606. (2) 								        Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign construction material. (3) 								        If removal and replacement of foreign construction material incorporated in a building or work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Government, the contracting officer may determine in writing that the foreign construction material need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign construction material does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign construction material does not affect the Government’s right to suspend or debar a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier for violation of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute, or to exercise other contractual rights and remedies, such as reducing the contract price or terminating the contract for default. (4) 								        If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate contractual remedies, such as terminating the contract for default. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with subpart 9.4. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the agency’s inspector general or the officer responsible for criminal investigation.

Subpart 25.9 - Customs and Duties 25.900 Scope of subpart. This subpart provides policies and procedures for exempting from import duties certain supplies purchased under Government contracts.  25.901 Policy. United States laws impose duties on foreign supplies imported into the customs territory of the United States. Certain exemptions from these duties are available to Government agencies. Agencies must use these exemptions when the anticipated savings to appropriated funds will outweigh the administrative costs associated with processing required documentation.  25.902 Procedures. For regulations governing importations and duties, see the Customs Regulations issued by the U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury (19 CFR Chapter 1). Except as provided elsewhere in the Customs Regulations (see 19 CFR 10.100), all shipments of imported supplies purchased under Government contracts are subject to the usual Customs entry and examination requirements. Unless the agency obtains an exemption (see 25.903), those shipments are also subject to duty.  25.903 Exempted supplies.  (a) 						      Subchapters VIII and X of Chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ( 19 U.S.C. 1202) list supplies for which exemptions from duty may be obtained when imported into the customs territory of the United States under a Government contract. For certain of these supplies, the contracting agency must certify to the Commissioner of Customs that they are for the purpose stated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (see 19 CFR 10.102-104, 10.114, and 10.121 and 15 CFR Part 301 for requirements and formats). (b) 						      Supplies (excluding equipment) for Government-operated vessels or aircraft may be withdrawn from any customs-bonded warehouse, from continuous customs custody elsewhere than in a bonded warehouse, or from a foreign-trade zone, free of duty and internal revenue tax as provided in  19 U.S.C. 1309 and  1317. The contracting activity must cite this authority on the appropriate customs form when making purchases (see 19 CFR 10.59 - 10.65).  Subpart 25.10 - Additional Foreign Acquisition Regulations 25.1001 Waiver of right to examination of records.  (a) Policy. The clause at 52.215-2, Audit and Records-Negotiation, prescribed at 15.209(b), and paragraph (d) of the clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, prescribed at 12.301(b)(4), implement             10 U.S.C. 3841                     and  41 U.S.C. 4706. The basic clauses authorize examination of records by the Comptroller General. (1) Insert the appropriate basic clause, whenever possible, in negotiated contracts with foreign contractors. (2) The contracting officer may use 52.215-2 with its Alternate III or 52.212-5 with its Alternate I after- (i) Exhausting all reasonable efforts to include the basic clause; (ii) Considering factors such as alternate sources of supply, additional cost, and time of delivery; and (iii) The head of the agency has executed a determination and findings in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General. However, concurrence of the Comptroller General is not required if the contractor is a foreign government or agency thereof or is precluded by the laws of the country involved from making its records available for examination. (b) Determination and findings. The determination and findings must- (1) Identify the contract and its purpose, and identify if the contract is with a foreign contractor or with a foreign government or an agency of a foreign government; (2) Describe the efforts to include the basic clause; (3) State the reasons for the contractor’s refusal to include the basic clause; (4) Describe the price and availability of the supplies or services from the United States and other sources; and (5) Determine that it will best serve the interest of the United States to use the appropriate alternate clause in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  25.1002 Use of foreign currency.  (a) 						      Unless an international agreement or the WTO GPA (see 25.408(a)(4)) requires a specific currency, contracting officers must determine whether solicitations for contracts to be entered into and performed outside the United States will require submission of offers in U.S. currency or a specified foreign currency. In unusual circumstances, the contracting officer may permit submission of offers in other than a specified currency. (b) 						      To ensure a fair evaluation of offers, solicitations generally should require all offers to be priced in the same currency. However, if the solicitation permits submission of offers in other than a specified currency, the contracting officer must convert the offered prices to U.S. currency for evaluation purposes. The contracting officer must use the current market exchange rate from a commonly used source in effect as follows: (1) 								        For acquisitions conducted using sealed bidding procedures, on the date of bid opening. (2) 								        For acquisitions conducted using negotiation procedures- (i) 										          On the date specified for receipt of offers, if award is based on initial offers; otherwise (ii) 										          On the date specified for receipt of final proposal revisions. (c) 						      If a contract is priced in foreign currency, the agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency fluctuations to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act ( 31 U.S.C. 1341,  1342,  1511-1519).  25.1003 	Tax on certain foreign	procurements. See 29.204 for the imposition	of the tax on certain foreign procurements pursuant to the James	Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 ( Pub. L. 111-347),  26 U.S.C. 5000 C, and	its implementing regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1 through 1.5000C-7.  Subpart 25.11 - Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses 25.1101 Acquisition of supplies.

(iii) If the acquisition value is $92,319 or more but is less than $100,000, use the clause with its Alternate III. (iv) The contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate IV to reflect the domestic content threshold that will apply to the entire period of performance, when the senior procurement executive allows for application of an alternate domestic content test for the contract in accordance with 25.102(d). For contracts that the contracting officer estimates will be awarded in calendar year 2022 or 2023, the contracting officer shall insert “60” in paragraph (1)(ii)(A) of the definition of “domestic end product.” For contracts that the contracting officer estimates will be awarded in calendar year 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, or 2028, the contracting officer shall insert “65”.
