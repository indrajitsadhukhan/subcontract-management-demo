This part prescribes policies and procedures to promote full and open competition in the acquisition process and to provide for full and open competition, full and open competition after exclusion of sources, other than full and open competition, and advocates for competition. This part does not deal with the results of competition (e.g., adequate price competition), that are addressed in other parts (e.g., part  15).  6.001 Applicability. This part applies to all acquisitions except— (a) Contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of part  13 (but see 13.501 for requirements pertaining to sole source acquisitions of commercial products or commercial services, under subpart  13.5); (b) Contracts awarded using contracting procedures (other than those addressed in this part) that are expressly authorized by statute; (c) Contract modifications, that are within the scope of the contract, including the exercise of priced options that were evaluated as part of the original competition (see 17.207(f)); (d) Orders placed under requirements contracts or definite-quantity contracts; (e) Orders placed under indefinite-quantity contracts that were entered into pursuant to this part when- (1) The contract was awarded under subpart  6.1 or 6.2 and all responsible sources were realistically permitted to compete for the requirements contained in the order; or (2) The contract was awarded under subpart  6.3 and the required justification and approval adequately covers the requirements contained in the order; or (f) Orders placed against task order and delivery order contracts entered into pursuant to subpart  16.5.  6.002 Limitations. No agency shall contract for supplies or services from another agency for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this part.  6.003 [Reserved] Subpart 6.1 - Full and Open Competition 6.100 Scope of subpart. This subpart prescribes the policy and procedures that are to be used to promote and provide for full and open competition.  6.101 Policy.  (a) 10 U.S.C. 3201                     and  41 U.S.C.3301 require, with certain limited exceptions (see subpart  6.2 and 6.3), that contracting officers shall promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding Government contracts. (b) Contracting officers shall provide for full and open competition through use of the competitive procedure(s) contained in this subpart that are best suited to the circumstances of the contract action and consistent with the need to fulfill the Government’s requirements efficiently (            10 U.S.C. 3201                     and  41 U.S.C.3301).  6.102 Use of competitive procedures. The competitive procedures available for use in fulfilling the requirement for full and open competition are as follows: (a) Sealed bids. (See 6.401(a).) (b) Competitive proposals. (See 6.401(b).) If sealed bids are not appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section, contracting officers shall request competitive proposals or use the other competitive procedures under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. (c) Combination of competitive procedures. If sealed bids are not appropriate, contracting officers may use any combination of competitive procedures (e.g., two-step sealed bidding). (d)          						      Other competitive procedures. (1)             								        Selection of sources for architect-engineer contracts in accordance with the provisions of  40 U.S.C. 1102 et seq. is a competitive procedure (see subpart  36.6 for procedures). (2)             								        Competitive selection of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement is a competitive procedure if award results from- (i)                										          A broad agency announcement that is general in nature identifying areas of research interest, including criteria for selecting proposals, and soliciting the participation of all offerors capable of satisfying the Government’s needs; and (ii)                										          A peer or scientific review. (3)             								        Use of multiple award schedules issued under the procedures established by the Administrator of General Services consistent with the requirement of  41 U.S.C.152(3)(A) for the multiple award schedule program of the General Services Administration is a competitive procedure.  Subpart 6.2 - Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources 6.200 Scope of subpart. This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for providing for full and open competition after excluding one or more sources.  6.201 Policy. Acquisitions made under this subpart require use of the competitive procedures prescribed in 6.102.  6.202 Establishing or maintaining alternative sources.  (a)          						      Agencies may exclude a particular source from a contract action in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources for the supplies or services being acquired if the agency head determines that to do so would- (1)             								        Increase or maintain competition and likely result in reduced overall costs for the acquisition, or for any anticipated acquisition; (2)             								        Be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the supplies or services in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization; (3)             								        Be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center; (4)             								        Ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supplies or services; (5)             								        Satisfy projected needs based on a history of high demand; or (6)             								        Satisfy a critical need for medical, safety, or emergency supplies. (b)  (1)             								        Every proposed contract action under the authority of paragraph (a) of this section shall be supported by a determination and findings (D&F) (see subpart  1.7) signed by the head of the agency or designee. This D&F shall not be made on a class basis. (2)             								        Technical and requirements personnel are responsible for providing all necessary data to support their recommendation to exclude a particular source. (3)             								        When the authority in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is cited, the findings shall include a description of the estimated reduction in overall costs and how the estimate was derived.  6.203 Set-asides for small business concerns.  (a)          						      To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to small business concerns, contracting officers may set aside solicitations to allow only such business concerns to compete. This includes contract actions conducted under the Small Business Innovation Research Program established under Pub.L.97-219. (b)          						      No separate justification or determination and findings is required under this part to set aside a contract action for small business concerns. (c)          						      Subpart  19.5 prescribes policies and procedures that shall be followed with respect to set-asides.  6.204 Section 8(a) competition.  (a)          						       To fulfill statutory requirements relating to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 100-656, contracting officers may limit competition to eligible 8(a) participants (see subpart  19.8). (b)          						       No separate justification or determination and findings is required under this part to limit competition to eligible 8(a) participants. (But see 6.302-5 and 6.303-1 for sole source 8(a) awards over 							$25 million.) 						 					  6.205 Set-asides for HUBZone small business concerns.  (a)          To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to the HUBZone Act of 1997 ( 15 U.S.C. 631 note), contracting officers may set aside solicitations to allow only HUBZone small business concerns to compete (see 19.1305).         (b) No separate justification or determination and findings is required under this part to set aside a contract action for HUBZone small business concerns.  6.206 Set-asides for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  (a)          						      To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to the Veterans Benefits Act of2003 ( 15 U.S.C.657f), contracting officers may set-aside solicitations to allow only service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns to compete (see 19.1405). (b)          						      No separate justification or determination and findings are required under this part to set aside a contract action for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  6.207 Set-asides for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) concerns or women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.  (a)          						      To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to  15 U.S.C. 637(m), contracting officers may set aside solicitations for only EDWOSB concerns or WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program (see 19.1505). (b)          						      No separate justification or determination and findings is required under this part to set aside a contract action for EDWOSB concerns or WOSB concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.  6.208 Set-asides for local firms during a major disaster or emergency.  (a)          						      To fulfill the statutory requirements relating to  42 U.S.C. 5150, contracting officers may set aside solicitations to allow only offerors residing or doing business primarily in the area affected by such major disaster or emergency to compete (see subpart  26.2). (b)          						      No separate justification or determination and findings is required under this part to set aside a contract action. The set-aside area specified by the contracting officer shall be a geographic area within the area identified in a Presidential declaration(s) of major disaster or emergency and any additional geographic areas identified by the Department of Homeland Security.  Subpart 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition 6.300 Scope of subpart. This subpart prescribes policies and procedures, and identifies the statutory authorities, for contracting without providing for full and open competition.  6.301 Policy.  (a) 41 U.S.C.3304 and             10 U.S.C. 3204                     each authorize, under certain conditions, contracting without providing for full and open competition. The Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration are subject to “            10 U.S.C. 3204. Other executive agencies are subject to  41 U.S.C.3304. Contracting without providing for full and open competition or full and open competition after exclusion of sources is a violation of statute, unless permitted by one of the exceptions in 6.302. (b)          						      Each contract awarded without providing for full and open competition shall contain a reference to the specific authority under which it was so awarded. Contracting officers shall use the U.S. Code citation applicable to their agency. (See 6.302.) (c)          						      Contracting without providing for full and open competition shall not be justified on the basis of- (1)             								        A lack of advance planning by the requiring activity; or (2)             								        Concerns related to the amount of funds available (e.g., funds will expire) to the agency or activity for the acquisition of supplies or services. (d)          						      When not providing for full and open competition, the contracting officer shall solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. (e)          						      For contracts under this subpart, the contracting officer shall use the contracting procedures prescribed in 6.102(a) or (b), if appropriate, or any other procedures authorized by this regulation.  6.302 Circumstances permitting other than full and open competition. The following statutory authorities (including applications and limitations) permit contracting without providing for full and open competition. Requirements for justifications to support the use of these authorities are in 6.303.  6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  (a)          						      Authority. (1) Citations:                10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(1)                           or  41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1). (2)             								        When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. (i)                										          Supplies or services may be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that- (A)                   												            Demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see definition at 2.101), or, demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the particular research services proposed; (B)                   												            Offers a concept or services not otherwise available to the Government; and (C) Does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive acquisition. (See                      10 U.S.C. 3204(b)(A)                                       and  41 U.S.C. 3304(b)(1).) (ii)                										          Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A)                   												            Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See  10 U.S.C. 3204(b)(B)                    or  41 U.S.C. 3304(b)(2).) (iii)                										          For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A)                   												            Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See  10 U.S.C. 3204(b)(B)).  (b) Application. This authority shall be used, if appropriate, in preference to the authority in 6.302-7; it shall not be used when any of the other circumstances is applicable. Use of this authority may be appropriate in situations such as the following (these examples are not intended to be all inclusive and do not constitute authority in and of themselves): (1)             								        When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by- (i)                										          Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; or (ii)                										          For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities. (2)             								        The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source (however, the mere existence of such rights or circumstances does not in and of itself justify the use of these authorities) (see part  27). (3)             								        When acquiring utility services (see 41.101), circumstances may dictate that only one supplier can furnish the service (see 41.202); or when the contemplated contract is for construction of a part of a utility system and the utility company itself is the only source available to work on the system. (4)             								        When the agency head has determined in accordance with the agency’s standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency’s needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available. (c)          						      Application for brand-name descriptions. (1)             								        An acquisition or portion of an acquisition that uses a brand-name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand-name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer- (i)                										          Does not provide for full and open competition, regardless of the number of sources solicited; and (ii)                										          Shall be justified and approved in accordance with 6.303 and 6.304. (A)                   												            If only a portion of the acquisition is for a brand-name product or item peculiar to one manufacturer, the justification and approval is to cover only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name or peculiar to one manufacturer. The justification should state it is covering only the portion of the acquisition which is brand-name or peculiar to one manufacturer, and the approval level requirements will then only apply to that portion; (B)                   												            The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition or portion of an acquisition is essential to the Government’s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company; and (C)                   												            The justification shall be posted with the solicitation (see 5.102(a)(6)). (2)             								        Brand-name or equal descriptions, and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand-name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use. (d)          						      Limitations. (1)             								        Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. (2)             								        For contracts awarded using this authority, the notices required by 5.201 shall have been published and any bids, proposals, quotations, or capability statements must have been considered.  6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency.  (a)          						      Authority. (1) Citations:                10 U.S.C. 3204(a)(2)                           or  41 U.S.C.3304(a)(2). (2)             								        When the agency’s need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for. (b) Application. This authority applies in those situations where- (1)             								        An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition; and (2)             								        Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government. (c)          						      Limitations. (1)             								        Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition. (2)             								        This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. (d)          						      Period of Performance. (1)             								        The total period of performance of a contract awarded or modified using this authority- (i)                										          May not exceed the time necessary- (A)                   												            To meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the work to be performed under the contract; and (B)                   												            For the agency to enter into another contract for the required goods and services through the use of competitive procedures; and (ii)                										          May not exceed one year, including all options, unless the head of the agency determines that exceptional circumstances apply. This determination must be documented in the contract file. (2)  (i)                										          Any subsequent modification using this authority, which will extend the period of performance beyond one year under this same authority, requires a separate determination. This determination is only required if the cumulative period of performance using this authority exceeds one year. This requirement does not apply to the exercise of options previously addressed in the determination required at paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. (ii)                										          The determination shall be approved at the same level as the level to which the agency head authority in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)of this section is delegated.

(8)             								         A description of the market research conducted (see part  10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

(b)          						       Any justification for a contract awarded under the authority of 6.302-7, regardless of dollar amount, shall be considered approved when the determination required by 6.302-7(c)(1) is made.

(a) The agency shall make publicly available the justification required by 6.303-1 as required by  10 U. S.C. 2304(l) and             10 U.S.C. 3204(f). Except for the circumstances in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the justification shall be made publicly available within 14 days after contract award. (b) In the case of a contract award permitted under 6.302-2, the justification shall be posted within 30 days after contract award. (c) In the case of a brand name justification under 6.302-1(c), the justification shall be posted with the solicitation (see 5.102(a)(6)).

(2) On the website of the agency, which may provide access to the justifications by linking to the GPE; and (3) Must remain posted for a minimum of 30 days. (e) Contracting officers shall carefully screen all justifications for contractor proprietary data and remove all such data, and such references and citations as are necessary to protect the proprietary data, before making the justifications available for public inspection. Contracting officers shall also be guided by the exemptions to disclosure of information contained in the Freedom of Information Act ( 5 U.S.C. 552) and the prohibitions against disclosure in 24.202 in determining whether the justification, or portions of it, are exempt from posting. Although the submitter notice process set out in EO 12600, entitled "Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information," does not apply, if the justification appears to contain proprietary data, the contracting officer should provide the contractor that submitted the information an opportunity to review the justification for proprietary data, before making the justification available for public inspection, redacted as necessary. This process must not prevent or delay the posting of the justification in accordance with the timeframes required in paragraphs (a) through (c). (f) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) do not apply if posting the justification would disclose the executive agency’s needs and disclosure of such needs would compromise national security or create other security risks.  Subpart 6.4 - Sealed Bidding and Competitive Proposals 6.401 Sealed bidding and competitive proposals. Sealed bidding and competitive proposals, as described in parts  14 and 15, are both acceptable procedures for use under subparts  6.1, 6.2; and, when appropriate, under subpart  6.3. (a) Sealed bids. (See part  14 for procedures.) Contracting officers shall solicit sealed bids if- (1)             								        Time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids; (2)             								        The award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors; (3)             								        It is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding offerors about their bids; and (4)             								        There is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid. (b)          						      Competitive proposals. (See part  15 for procedures.) (1)             								        Contracting officers may request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section. (2)             								        Because of differences in areas such as law, regulations, and business practices, it is generally necessary to conduct discussions with offerors relative to proposed contracts to be made and performed outside the United States and its outlying areas. Competitive proposals will therefore be used for these contracts unless discussions are not required and the use of sealed bids is otherwise appropriate.  Subpart 6.5 - Advocates for Competition 6.501 Requirement. As required by  41 U.S.C. 1705, the head of each executive agency shall designate an advocate for competition for the agency and for each procuring activity of the agency.
