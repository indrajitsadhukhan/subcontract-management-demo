Parent topic: Federal Acquisition Regulation 4.000 Scope of part. This part prescribes policies and procedures relating to the administrative aspects of contract execution, contractor-submitted paper documents, distribution, reporting, retention, and files.  4.001 Definitions. As used in this part- Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID) means the Government-unique identifier for each solicitation, contract, agreement, or order. For example, an agency may use as its PIID for procurement actions, such as delivery and task orders or basic ordering agreements, the order or agreement number in conjunction with the contract number (see 4.1602). Supplementary procurement instrument identifier means the non-unique identifier for a procurement action that is used in conjunction with the Government-unique identifier. For example, an agency may use as its PIID for an amended solicitation, the Government-unique identifier for a solicitation number (e.g., N0002309R0009) in conjunction with a non-unique amendment number (e.g., 0001). The non-unique amendment number represents the supplementary PIID.  Subpart 4.1 - Contract Execution 4.101 Contracting officer’s signature. Only contracting officers shall sign contracts on behalf of the United States. The contracting officer’s name and official title shall be typed, stamped, or printed on the contract. The contracting officer normally signs the contract after it has been signed by the contractor. The contracting officer shall ensure that the signer(s) have authority to bind the contractor (see specific requirements in 4.102 of this subpart).  4.102 Contractor’s signature.  (a) Individuals. A contract with an individual shall be signed by that individual.

(c) Corporations. A contract with a corporation shall be signed in the corporate name, followed by the word "by" and the signature and title of the person authorized to sign. The contracting officer shall ensure that the person signing for the corporation has authority to bind the corporation. (d) Joint venturers. A contract with joint venturers may involve any combination of individuals, partnerships, or corporations. The contract shall be signed by each participant in the joint venture in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section for each type of participant. When a corporation is participating, the contracting officer shall verify that the corporation is authorized to participate in the joint venture. (e) Agents. When an agent is to sign the contract, other than as stated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, the agent’s authorization to bind the principal must be established by evidence satisfactory to the contracting officer.  4.103 Contract clause. The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.204-1 Approval of Contract, in solicitations and contracts if required by agency procedures.  Subpart 4.2 - Contract Distribution 4.201 Procedures. Contracting officers shall distribute copies of contracts or modifications within 10 working days after execution by all parties.

(b)          						      When electronic commerce methods (see 4.502) are not used, agencies shall require contractors to submit paper documents to the Government relating to an acquisition printed or copied double-sided on at least 30 percent postconsumer fiber paper whenever practicable. If the contractor cannot print or copy double-sided, it shall print or copy single-sided on at least 30 percent postconsumer fiber paper.  4.303 Contract clause. Insert the clause at 52.204-4, Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Recycled Paper, in solicitations and contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Subpart 4.4 - Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry 4.401 [Reserved] 4.402 General.  (a) Executive Order12829, January 6, 1993 (58 FR3479, January 8, 1993), entitled "National Industrial Security Program" (NISP), establishes a program to safeguard Federal Government classified information that is released to contractors, licensees, and grantees of the United States Government. Executive Order 12829 amends Executive Order 10865, February 20, 1960 (25 FR1583, February 25, 1960), entitled "Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry," as amended by Executive Order 10909, January 17, 1961 (26 FR508, January 20, 1961). (b) The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) incorporates the requirements of these Executive orders. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with all affected agencies and with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, is responsible for issuance and maintenance of this Manual. The following publications implement the program: (1) National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (32 CFR part 117). (2) DoD Manual 5220.22, Volume 2, National Industrial Security Program: Industrial Security Procedures for Government Activities. (c) Procedures for the protection of information relating to foreign classified contracts awarded to U.S. industry, and instructions for the protection of U.S. information relating to classified contracts awarded to foreign firms, are prescribed in 32 CFR 117.19. (d) Nondefense agencies that have industrial security services agreements with DoD, and DoD components, shall use the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, to provide security classification guidance to U.S. contractors, and subcontractors as applicable, requiring access to information classified as "Confidential", "Secret", or "Top Secret". (1) Provided that the data submittal is unclassified, the DD Form 254 shall be completed electronically in the NISP Contract Classification System (NCCS), which is accessible at               https://www.dcsa.mil/is/nccs/                           . Nondefense agencies with an existing DD Form 254 information system may use that system. (2)  (i) A contractor, or subcontractor (if applicable), requiring access to classified information under a contract shall be identified with a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code on the DD Form 254 (see subpart 4.18 for information on obtaining and validating CAGE codes). (ii) Each location of contractor or subcontractor performance listed on the DD Form 254 is required to reflect a corresponding unique CAGE code for each listed location unless the work is being performed at a Government facility, in which case the agency location code shall be used. Each subcontractor location requiring access to classified information must be listed on the DD Form 254. (iii) Contractor and subcontractor performance locations listed on the DD Form 254 are not required to be separately registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) solely for the purposes of a DD Form 254 (see subpart 4.11 for information on registering in SAM). (e) Part  27, Patents, Data, and Copyrights, contains policy and procedures for safeguarding classified information in patent applications and patents.  4.403 Responsibilities of contracting officers.  (a) Presolicitation phase. Contracting officers shall review all proposed solicitations to determine whether access to classified information may be required by offerors, or by a contractor during contract performance. (1)             								        If access to classified information of another agency may be required, the contracting officer shall- (i)                										          Determine if the agency is covered by the NISP; and (ii)                										          Follow that agency’s procedures for determining the security clearances of firms to be solicited. (2)             								        If the classified information required is from the contracting officer’s agency, the contracting officer shall follow agency procedures. (b) Solicitation phase. Contracting officers shall- (1)             								        Ensure that the classified acquisition is conducted as required by the NISP or agency procedures, as appropriate; and (2)             								        Include- (i)                										          An appropriate Security Requirements clause in the solicitation (see 4.404); and (ii)                										          As appropriate, in solicitations and contracts when the contract may require access to classified information, a requirement for security safeguards in addition to those provided in the clause (52.204-2, Security Requirements). (c) Award phase. Contracting officers shall inform contractors and subcontractors of the security classifications and requirements assigned to the various documents, materials, tasks, subcontracts, and components of the classified contract as identified in the requirement documentation as follows: (1)             								        Nondefense agencies that have industrial security services agreements with DoD, and DoD components, shall use the Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254. The contracting officer, or authorized agency representative, is the approving official for the DD Form 254 associated with the prime contract and shall ensure the DD Form 254 is properly prepared, distributed by and coordinated with requirements and security personnel in accordance with agency procedures, see 4.402(d)(1). (2)             								        Contracting officers in agencies not covered by the NISP shall follow agency procedures.  4.404 Contract clause.  (a)          						      The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.204-2, Security Requirements, in solicitations and contracts when the contract may require access to classified information, unless the conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section apply. (b)          						      If a cost contract (see 16.302) for research and development with an educational institution is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I. (c)          						      If a construction or architect-engineer contract where employee identification is required for security reasons is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II. (d)          						      If the contracting agency is not covered by the NISP and has prescribed a clause and alternates that are substantially the same as those at 52.204-2, the contracting officer shall use the agency-prescribed clause as required by agency procedures.  Subpart 4.5 - Electronic Commerce in Contracting 4.500 Scope of subpart. This subpart provides policy and procedures for the establishment and use of electronic commerce in Federal acquisition as required by  41 U.S.C. 2301.  4.501 [Reserved] 4.502 Policy.  (a)          						      The Federal Government shall use electronic commerce whenever practicable or cost-effective. The use of terms commonly associated with paper transactions (e.g.,"copy," "document," "page," "printed," "sealed envelope," and "stamped") shall not be interpreted to restrict the use of electronic commerce. Contracting officers may supplement electronic transactions by using other media to meet the requirements of any contract action governed by the FAR (e.g., transmit hard copy of drawings). (b)          						      Agencies may exercise broad discretion in selecting the hardware and software that will be used in conducting electronic commerce. However, as required by  41 U.S.C. 2301, the head of each agency, after consulting with the Administrator of OFPP, shall ensure that systems, technologies, procedures, and processes used by the agency to conduct electronic commerce- (1)             								        Are implemented uniformly throughout the agency, to the maximum extent practicable; (2)             								        Are implemented only after considering the full or partial use of existing infrastructures; (3)             								        Facilitate access to Government acquisition opportunities by small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, women-owned, veteran-owned, HUBZone, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; (4)             								        Include a single means of providing widespread public notice of acquisition opportunities through the Governmentwide point of entry and a means of responding to notices or solicitations electronically; and (5)             								        Comply with nationally and internationally recognized standards that broaden interoperability and ease the electronic interchange of information, such as standards established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. (c)          						      Before using electronic commerce, the agency head shall ensure that the agency systems are capable of ensuring authentication and confidentiality commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information. (d)          						      Agencies may accept electronic signatures and records in connection with Government contracts.  Subpart 4.6 - Contract Reporting 4.600 Scope of subpart. This subpart prescribes uniform reporting requirements for the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).  4.601 Definitions. As used in this subpart— Contract action means any oral or written action that results in the purchase, rent, or lease of supplies or equipment, services, or construction using appropriated dollars over the micro-purchase threshold, or modifications to these actions regardless of dollar value. Contract action does not include grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions, real property leases, requisitions from Federal stock, training authorizations, or other non-FAR based transactions. Contract action report (CAR) means contract action data required to be entered into the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). Definitive contract means any contract that must be reported to FPDS other than an indefinite delivery vehicle. This definition is only for FPDS, and is not intended to apply to part  16. Entitlement program means a Federal program that guarantees a certain level of benefits to persons or other entities who meet requirements set by law, such as Social Security, farm price supports, or unemployment benefits. Generic entity identifier means a number or other identifier assigned to a category of vendors and not specific to any individual or entity. Indefinite delivery vehicle (IDV) means an indefinite delivery contract or agreement that has one or more of the following clauses: (1) 52.216-18, Ordering. (2) 52.216-19, Order Limitations. (3) 52.216-20, Definite Quantity. (4) 52.216-21, Requirements. (5) 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity. (6) Any other clause allowing ordering.  4.602 General.  (a)          						      The FPDS provides a comprehensive web-based tool for agencies to report contract actions. The resulting data provides- (1)             								        A basis for recurring and special reports to the President, the Congress, the Government Accountability Office, Federal executive agencies, and the general public; (2)             								        A means of measuring and assessing the effect of Federal contracting on the Nation's economy and the extent to which small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small business concerns, and AbilityOne nonprofit agencies operating under  41 U.S.C. chapter 85, Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, are sharing in Federal contracts; (3)             								        A means of measuring and assessing the effect of Federal contracting for promoting sustainable technologies, materials, products, and high-performance sustainable buildings. This is accomplished by collecting and reporting agency data on sustainable acquisition, including types of products purchased, the purchase costs, and the exceptions used for other than sustainable acquisition; and (4)             								        A means of measuring and assessing the effect of other policy and management initiatives (e.g., performance based acquisitions and competition). (b)          						      FPDS does not provide reports for certain acquisition information used in the award of a contract action (e.g., subcontracting data, funding data, or accounting data). (c)          						      The FPDS Web site,  https://www.fpds.gov, provides instructions for submitting data. It also provides- (1)             								        A complete list of departments, agencies, and other entities that submit data to the FPDS; (2)             								        Technical and end-user guidance; (3)             								        A computer-based tutorial; and (4)             								        Information concerning reports not generated in FPDS.  4.603 Policy.  (a)          						      In accordance with the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282), all unclassified Federal award data must be publicly accessible. (b)          						      Executive agencies shall use FPDS to maintain publicly available information about all unclassified contract actions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, and any modifications to those actions that change previously reported contract action report data, regardless of dollar value. (c)          						      Agencies awarding assisted acquisitions or direct acquisitions must report these actions and identify the Program/Funding Agency and Office Codes from the applicable agency codes maintained by each agency at FPDS. These codes represent the agency and office that has provided the predominant amount of funding for the contract action. For assisted acquisitions, the requesting agency will receive socioeconomic credit for meeting agency small business goals, where applicable. Requesting agencies shall provide the appropriate agency/bureau component code as part of the written interagency agreement between the requesting and servicing agencies (see 17.502-1(a)(1)). (d)          						      Agencies awarding contract actions with a mix of appropriated and non-appropriated funding shall only report the full appropriated portion of the contract action in FPDS.  4.604 Responsibilities.  (a)          						      The Senior Procurement Executive in coordination with the head of the contracting activity is responsible for developing and monitoring a process to ensure timely and accurate reporting of contractual actions to FPDS. (b)  (1)             								        The responsibility for the completion and accuracy of the individual contract action report (CAR) resides with the contracting officer who awarded the contract action. CARs in a draft or error status in FPDS are not considered complete. (2)             								        The CAR must be confirmed for accuracy by the contracting officer prior to release of the contract award. The CAR must then be completed in FPDS within three business days after contract award. (3)             								        For any action awarded in accordance with FAR 6.302-2 or pursuant to any of the authorities listed at subpart 18.2, the CAR must be completed in FPDS within 30 days after contract award. (4)             								        When the contracting office receives written notification that a contractor has changed its size status in accordance with the clause at 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, the contracting officer shall update the size status in FPDS within 30 days after receipt of contractor’s notification of rerepresentation. (5)             								        If after award of a contract, the contracting officer receives written notification of SBA’s final decision on a protest concerning a size determination, the contracting officer shall update FPDS to reflect the final decision. (c)          						      The chief acquisition officer of each agency required to report its contract actions must submit to the General Services Administration (GSA), in accordance with FPDS guidance, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an annual certification of whether, and to what degree, agency CAR data for the preceding fiscal year is complete and accurate.  4.605 Procedures.  (a) Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID reported to FPDS is unique Governmentwide, for all solicitations, contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic agreements, basic ordering agreements, or orders in accordance with 4.1601 to 4.1603, and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of contract award. Other pertinent PIID instructions for FPDS reporting can be found at  https://www.fpds.gov. (b) Unique entity identifier. The contracting officer shall identify and report a unique entity identifier for the successful offeror on a contract action. The unique entity identifier shall correspond to the successful offeror's name and address as stated in the offer and resultant contract, and as registered in the System for Award Management in accordance with the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management. The contracting officer shall ask the offeror to provide its unique entity identifier by using either the provision at 52.204-6, Unique Entity Identifier, the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management, or the provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. (For a discussion of the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, which is a different identifier, see subpart  4.18.) (c) Generic entity identifier. (1) The use of a generic entity identifier should be limited, and only used in the situations described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Use of a generic entity identifier does not supersede the requirements of provisions 52.204-6, Unique Entity Identifier or 52.204-7 System for Award Management (if present in the solicitation) for the contractor to have a unique entity identifier assigned. (2) Authorized generic entity identifiers, maintained by the Integrated Award Environment (IAE) program office ( http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105036), may be used to report contracts in lieu of the contractor's actual unique entity identifier only for— (i) Contract actions valued at or below $30,000 that are awarded to a contractor that is- (A) A student; (B) A dependent of either a veteran, foreign service officer, or military member assigned outside the United States and its outlying areas (as defined in 2.101); or (C) Located outside the United States and its outlying areas for work to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas and the contractor does not otherwise have a unique entity identifier; (ii) Contracts valued above $30,000 awarded to individuals located outside the United States and its outlying areas for work to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas; or (iii) Contracts when specific public identification of the contracted party could endanger the mission, contractor, or recipients of the acquired goods or services. The contracting officer must include a written determination in the contract file of a decision applicable to authority under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii). (d) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act actions. The contracting officer, when entering data in FPDS, shall use the instructions at  https://www.fpds.gov to identify any action funded in whole or in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5). (e) Office codes. Agencies shall by March 31, 2016— (1) Use the Activity Address Code (AAC), as defined in 2.101, assigned to the issuing contracting office as the contracting office code, and (2) Use the AAC assigned to the program/funding office providing the predominance of funding for the contract action as the program/funding office code.  4.606 Reporting Data.  (a) Actions required to be reported to FPDS. (1)             								        As a minimum, agencies must report the following contract actions over the micro-purchase threshold, regardless of solicitation process used, and agencies must report any modification to these contract actions that change previously reported contract action data, regardless of dollar value: (i)                										          Definitive contracts, including purchase orders and imprest fund buys over the micro-purchase threshold awarded by a contracting officer. (ii)                										          Indefinite delivery vehicle (identified as an "IDV" in FPDS). Examples of IDVs include the following: (A)                   												            Task and Delivery Order Contracts (see subpart  16.5), including– (1)                      														              Government-wide acquisition contracts. (2)                      														              Multi-agency contracts. (B)                   												            GSA Federal supply schedules. (C)                   												            Blanket Purchase Agreements (see 13.303). (D)                   												            Basic Ordering Agreements (see 16.703). (E)                   												            Any other agreement or contract against which individual orders or purchases may be placed. (iii)                										          All calls and orders awarded under the indefinite delivery vehicles identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. (2)             								        The GSA Office of Charge Card Management will provide the Government purchase card data, at a minimum annually, and GSA will incorporate that data into FPDS for reports. (3)             								        Agencies may use the FPDS Express Reporting capability for consolidated multiple action reports for a vendor when it would be overly burdensome to report each action individually. When used, Express Reporting should be done at least monthly. (b) Reporting other actions. Agencies may submit actions other than those listed at paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if they are able to be segregated from FAR-based actions and this is approved in writing by the FPDS Program Office. Prior to the commencement of reporting, agencies must contact the FPDS Program Office if they desire to submit any of the following types of activity: (1)             								        Transactions at or below the micro-purchase threshold, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (2)             								        Any non-appropriated fund (NAF) or NAF portion of a contract action using a mix of appropriated and non-appropriated funding. (3)             								        Lease and supplemental lease agreements for real property. (4)             								        Grants and entitlement actions. (c) Actions not reported. The following types of contract actions are not to be reported to FPDS: (1)             								        Imprest fund transactions below the micro-purchase threshold, including those made via the Government purchase card (unless specific agency procedures prescribe reporting these actions). (2)             								        Orders from GSA stock and the GSA Global Supply Program. (3)             								        Purchases made at GSA or AbilityOne service stores, as these items stocked for resale have already been reported by GSA. (4)             								        Purchases made using non-appropriated fund activity cards, chaplain fund cards, individual Government personnel training orders, and Defense Printing orders. (5)             								        Actions that, pursuant to other authority, will not be entered in FPDS (e.g., reporting of the information would compromise national security). (6)             								        Contract actions in which the required data would constitute classified information. (7)             								        Resale activity (i.e., commissary or exchange activity). (8)             								        Revenue generating arrangements (i.e., concessions). (9)             								        Training expenditures not issued as orders or contracts. (10)             								        Interagency agreements other than inter-agency acquisitions required to be reported at 4.606(a)(1). (11)             								        Letters of obligation used in the A-76 process. (d)          						      Agencies not subject to the FAR. Agencies not subject to the FAR may be required by other authority (e.g., statute, OMB, or internal agency policy) to report certain information to FPDS. Those agencies not subject to the FAR must first receive approval from the FPDS Program Office prior to reporting to FPDS.  4.607 Solicitation provisions and contract clause.  (a)          						      Insert the provision at 52.204-5, Women-Owned Business (Other Than Small Business), in all solicitations that- (1)             								        Are not set aside for small business concerns; (2)             								        Exceed the simplified acquisition threshold; and (3)             								        Are for contracts that will be performed in the United States or its outlying areas. (b)          						      Insert the provision at 52.204-6, Unique Entity Identifier, in solicitations that do not contain the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management, or meet a condition at 4.605(c)(2). (c)          						      Insert the clause at 52.204-12, Unique Entity Identifier Maintenance, in solicitations and resulting contracts that contain the provision at 52.204-6, Unique Entity Identifier.  Subpart 4.7 - Contractor Records Retention 4.700 Scope of subpart. This subpart provides policies and procedures for retention of records by contractors to meet the records review requirements of the Government. In this subpart, the terms "contracts" and "contractors" include "subcontracts" and "subcontractors."  4.701 Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to generally describe records retention requirements and to allow reductions in the retention period for specific classes of records under prescribed circumstances.  4.702 Applicability.  (a)          						      This subpart applies to records generated under contracts that contain one of the following clauses: (1)             								        Audit and Records-Sealed Bidding ( 52.214-26). (2)             								        Audit and Records-Negotiation ( 52.215-2). (b) This subpart is not mandatory on Department of Energy contracts for which the Comptroller General allows alternative records retention periods. Apart from this exception, this subpart applies to record retention periods under contracts that are subject to 10 U.S.C. chapter 137 legacy provisions (  10 U.S.C. 3064) and  10 U.S.C. 3016 and chapter 203, or  40 U.S.C. 101, et seq.  4.703 Policy.  (a)          						      Except as stated in 4.703(b), contractors shall make available	records, which includes books, documents, accounting procedures and	practices, and other data, regardless of type and regardless of whether such	items are in written form, in the form of computer data, or in any other	form, and other supporting evidence to satisfy contract negotiation,	administration, and audit requirements of the contracting agencies and the	Comptroller General for- (1)             								        3 years after final payment; or (2)             								        For certain records the period specified in 4.705 through 4.705-3, whichever of these periods expires first. (b)          						      Contractors shall make	available the foregoing records and supporting evidence for a longer period	of time than is required in 4.703(a)	if- (1)             								        A retention	period longer than that cited in 4.703(a) is specified in any	contract clause; or (2)             								        The contractor, for its own purposes, retains the foregoing records and supporting evidence for a longer period. Under this circumstance, the retention period shall be the period of the contractor’s retention or 3 years after final payment, whichever period expires first. (3)             								        The contractor does not meet the original due date for submission of final indirect cost rate proposals specified in paragraph (d)(2) of the clause at 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment. Under these circumstances, the retention periods in 4.705 shall be automatically extended one day for each day the proposal is not submitted after the original due date. (c)          						      Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a contractor from duplicating or storing original records in electronic form unless they contain significant information not shown on the record copy. Original records need not be maintained or produced in an audit if the contractor or subcontractor provides photographic or electronic images of the original records and meets the following requirements: (1)             								        The contractor or subcontractor has established procedures to ensure that the imaging process preserves accurate images of the original records, including signatures and other written or graphic images, and that the imaging process is reliable and secure so as to maintain the integrity of the records. (2)             								        The contractor or subcontractor maintains an effective indexing system to permit timely and convenient access to the imaged records. (3)             								        The contractor or subcontractor retains the original records for a minimum of one year after imaging to permit periodic validation of the imaging systems. (d)          						      If the information described in paragraph (a) of this section is maintained on a computer, contractors shall retain the computer data on a reliable medium for the time periods prescribed. Contractors may transfer computer data in machine readable form from one reliable computer medium to another. Contractors’ computer data retention and transfer procedures shall maintain the integrity, reliability, and security of the original computer data. Contractors shall also retain an audit trail describing the data transfer. For the record retention time periods prescribed, contractors shall not destroy, discard, delete, or write over such computer data.  4.704 Calculation of retention periods.  (a)          						      The retention periods in 4.705 are calculated from the end of the contractor’s fiscal year in which an entry is made charging or allocating a cost to a Government contract or subcontract. If a specific record contains a series of entries, the retention period is calculated from the end of the contractor’s fiscal year in which the final entry is made. The contractor should cut off the records in annual blocks and retain them for block disposal under the prescribed retention periods. (b)          						      When records generated during a prior contract are relied upon by a contractor for certified cost or pricing data in negotiating a succeeding contract, the prescribed periods shall run from the date of the succeeding contract. (c)          						      If two or more of the record categories described in 4.705 are interfiled and screening for disposal is not practical, the contractor shall retain the entire record series for the longest period prescribed for any category of records.  4.705 Specific retention periods. The contractor shall retain the records identified in 4.705-1 through 4.705-3 for the periods designated, provided retention is required under 4.702. Records are identified in this subpart in terms of their purpose or use and not by specific name or form number. Although the descriptive identifications may not conform to normal contractor usage or filing practices, these identifications apply to all contractor records that come within the description.  4.705-1 Financial and cost accounting records.  (a)          						      Accounts receivable invoices, adjustments to the accounts, invoice registers, carrier freight bills, shipping orders, and other documents which detail the material or services billed on the related invoices: Retain 4 years.

Subpart 4.8 - Government Contract Files 4.800 Scope of subpart. This subpart prescribes requirements for establishing, maintaining, and disposing of contract files.  4.801 General.  (a)          						      The head of each office performing contracting, contract administration, or paying functions shall establish files containing the records of all contractual actions. (b)          						      The documentation in the files (see 4.803) shall be sufficient to constitute a complete history of the transaction for the purpose of- (1)             								        Providing a complete background as a basis for informed decisions at each step in the acquisition process; (2)             								        Supporting actions taken; (3)             								        Providing information for reviews and investigations; and (4)             								        Furnishing essential facts in the event of litigation or congressional inquiries. (c)          						      The files to be established include- (1)             								        A file for cancelled solicitations; (2)             								        A file for each contract; and (3)             								        A file such as a contractor general file, containing documents relating, for example-to- (i)                										          No specific contract; (ii)                										          More than one contract; or (iii)                										          The contractor in a general way (e.g., contractor’s management systems, past performance, or capabilities).  4.802 Contract files.  (a)          						      A contract file should generally consist of- (1)             								        The contracting office contract file that documents the basis for the acquisition and the award, the assignment of contract administration (including payment responsibilities), and any subsequent actions taken by the contracting office; (2)             								        The contract administration office contract file that documents actions reflecting the basis for and the performance of contract administration responsibilities; and (3)             								        The paying office contract file that documents actions prerequisite to, substantiating, and reflecting contract payments. (b)          						      Normally, each file should be kept separately; however, if appropriate, any or all of the files may be combined; e.g., if all functions or any combination of the functions are performed by the same office. (c)          						      Files must be maintained at organizational levels that ensure- (1)             								        Effective documentation of contract actions; (2)             								        Ready accessibility to principal users; (3)             								        Minimal establishment of duplicate and working files; (4)             								        The safeguarding of classified documents; and (5)             								        Conformance with agency regulations for file location and maintenance. (d)          						      If the contract files or file segments are decentralized (e.g., by type or function) to various organizational elements or to other outside offices, responsibility for their maintenance must be assigned. A central control and, if needed, a locator system should be established to ensure the ability to locate promptly any contract files. (e)          						      Contents of contract files that are contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information as defined in 2.101 must be protected from disclosure to unauthorized persons (see 3.104-4). (f)          						      Agencies may retain contract files in any medium (paper, electronic, microfilm, etc.) or any combination of media, as long as the requirements of this subpart are satisfied.  4.803 Contents of contract files.

(a)          						      Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, time standards for closing out contract files are as follows: (1)             								        Files for contracts using simplified acquisition procedures should be considered closed when the contracting officer receives evidence of receipt of property and final payment, unless otherwise specified by agency regulations. (2)             								        Files for firm-fixed-price contracts, other than those using simplified acquisition procedures, should be closed within 6 months after the date on which the contracting officer receives evidence of physical completion. (3)             								        Files for contracts requiring settlement of indirect cost rates should be closed within 36 months of the month in which the contracting officer receives evidence of physical completion.

(b)          						      When closing out the contract files at 4.804-1(a)(2), (3), and (4), the contracting officer shall use the closeout procedures at 4.804-5. However, these closeout actions may be modified to reflect the extent of administration that has been performed. Quick closeout procedures (see 42.708) should be used, when appropriate, to reduce administrative costs and to enable deobligation of excess funds. (c)          						      A contract file shall not be closed if- (1)             								        The contract is in litigation or under appeal; or (2)             								        In the case of a termination, all termination actions have not been completed.  4.804-2 Closeout of the contracting office files if another office administers the contract.  (a)          						      Contract files for contracts using simplified acquisition procedures should be considered closed when the contracting officer receives evidence of receipt of property and final payment, unless otherwise specified by agency regulation. (b)          						      All other contract files shall be closed as soon as practicable after the contracting officer receives a contract completion statement from the contract administration office. The contracting officer shall ensure that all contractual actions required have been completed and shall prepare a statement to that effect. This statement is authority to close the contract file and shall be made a part of the official contract file.  4.804-3 Closeout of paying office contract files. The paying office shall close the contract file upon issuance of the final payment voucher.  4.804-4 Physically completed contracts.  (a)          						      Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a contract is considered to be physically completed when- (1)  (i)                										          The contractor has completed the required deliveries and the Government has inspected and accepted the supplies; (ii)                										          The contractor has performed all services and the Government has accepted these services; and (iii)                										          All option provisions, if any, have expired; or (2)             								        The Government has given the contractor a notice of complete contract termination. (b)          						      Rental, use, and storage agreements are considered to be physically completed when- (1)             								        The Government has given the contractor a notice of complete contract termination; or (2)             								        The contract period has expired.  4.804-5 Procedures for closing out contract files.  (a)          						      The contract administration office is responsible for initiating (automated or manual) administrative closeout of the contract after receiving evidence of its physical completion. At the outset of this process, the contract administration office must review the contract funds status and notify the contracting office of any excess funds the contract administration office might deobligate. When complete, the administrative closeout procedures must ensure that- (1)             								        Disposition of classified material is completed; (2) Final patent report is cleared. If a final patent report is required, the contracting officer may proceed with contract closeout in accordance with the following procedures, or as otherwise prescribed by agency procedures: (i)                										          Final patent reports should be cleared within 60 days of receipt. (ii)                										          If the final patent report is not received, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor of the contractor’s obligations and the Government’s rights under the applicable patent rights clause, in accordance with 27.303. If the contractor fails to respond to this notification, the contracting officer may proceed with contract closeout upon consultation with the agency legal counsel responsible for patent matters regarding the contractor’s failure to respond. (3)             								        Final royalty report is cleared; (4)             								        There is no outstanding value engineering change proposal; (5)             								        Plant clearance report is received; (6)             								        Property clearance is received; (7)             								        All interim or disallowed costs are settled; (8)             								        Price revision is completed; (9)             								        Subcontracts are settled by the prime contractor; (10)             								        Prior year indirect cost rates are settled; (11)             								        Termination docket is completed; (12)             								        Contract audit is completed; (13)             								        Contractor’s closing statement is completed; (14)             								        Contractor’s final invoice has been submitted; and (15)             								        Contract funds review is completed and excess funds deobligated. (b)          						      When the actions in paragraph (a) of this section have been verified, the contracting officer administering the contract must ensure that a contract completion statement, containing the following information, is prepared: (1)             								        Contract administration office name and address (if different from the contracting office). (2)             								        Contracting office name and address. (3)             								        Contract number. (4)             								        Last modification number. (5)             								        Last call or order number. (6)             								        Contractor name and address. (7)             								        Dollar amount of excess funds, if any. (8)             								        Voucher number and date, if final payment has been made. (9)             								        Invoice number and date, if the final approved invoice has been forwarded to a disbursing office of another agency or activity and the status of the payment is unknown. (10)             								        A statement that all required contract administration actions have been fully and satisfactorily accomplished. (11)             								        Name and signature of the contracting officer. (12)             								        Date. (c)          						      When the statement is completed, the contracting officer must ensure that- (1)             								        The signed original is placed in the contracting office contract file (or forwarded to the contracting office for placement in the files if the contract administration office is different from the contracting office); and (2)             								        A signed copy is placed in the appropriate contract administration file if administration is performed by a contract administration office.  4.805 Storage, handling, and contract files.  (a)          						      Agencies must prescribe	procedures for the handling, storing, and disposing of contract files, in	accordance with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)	General Records Schedule 1.1, Financial Management	and Reporting Records. The Financial Management and Reporting Records can be	found at  http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html. These procedures	must take into account documents held in all types of media, including	microfilm and various electronic media. Agencies may change the original	medium to facilitate storage as long as the requirements of the part, law,	and other regulations are satisfied. The process used to create and store	records must record and reproduce the original document, including	signatures and other written and graphic images completely, accurately, and	clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures must protect the	original data from alteration. Unless law or other regulations require	signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed after the responsible	agency official verifies that record copies on alternate media and copies	reproduced from the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear	representations of the originals. When original documents have been	converted to alternate media for storage, the requirements in Table 4-1 of this section also apply to	the record copies in the alternate media. (b)          						      If administrative records are mixed with program records and cannot be economically segregated, the entire file should be kept for the period of time approved for the program records. Similarly, if documents described in the following table are part of a subject or case file that documents activities that are not described in the table, they should be treated in the same manner as the files of which they are a part. (c)          						      An agency that requires a shorter retention period than those identified in Table 4-1 shall request approval from NARA through the agency’s records officer. Table 4-1 - Retention PeriodsRecord Retention period (1) Contracts (and related records or documents, including successful and unsuccessful proposals, except see paragraph (c)(2) of this section regarding contractor payrolls submitted under construction contracts).  6 years after final payment.  (2) Contractor’s payrolls submitted under construction contracts in accordance with Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)), with related certifications, anti-kickback affidavits, and other related records.  3 years after contract completion unless contract performance is the subject of an enforcement action on that date (see paragraph (c)(8) of this section).  (3) Unsolicited proposals not accepted by a department or agency.  Retain in accordance with agency procedures.  (4) Files for canceled solicitations.  6 years after cancellation.  (5) Other copies of procurement file records used for administrative purposes.  When business use ceases.  (6) Documents pertaining generally to the contractor as described at 4.801(c)(3).  Until superseded or obsolete.  (7) Data submitted to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).

(8) Investigations, cases pending or in litigation (including protests), or similar matters (including enforcement actions).  Until final clearance or settlement, or, if related to a document identified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section, for the retention period specified for the related document, whichever is later.   Subpart 4.9 - Taxpayer Identification Number Information 4.900 Scope of subpart. This subpart provides policies and procedures for obtaining- (a)          						      Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) information that may be used for debt collection purposes; and (b)          						      Contract information and payment information for submittal to the payment office for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting purposes.  4.901 Definition.  Common parent, as used in this subpart, means that corporate entity that owns or controls an affiliated group of corporations that files its Federal income tax returns on a consolidated basis, and of which the offeror is a member.  4.902 General.  (a) Debt collection.  31 U.S.C.7701(c) requires each contractor doing business with a Government agency to furnish its TIN to that agency.  31 U.S.C.3325(d) requires the Government to include, with each certified voucher prepared by the Government payment office and submitted to a disbursing official, the TIN of the contractor receiving payment under the voucher. The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the contractor’s relationship with the Government. (b) Information reporting to the IRS. The TIN is also required for Government reporting of certain contract information (see 4.903) and payment information (see 4.904) to the IRS.  4.903 Reporting contract information to the IRS.  (a) 26 U.S.C.6050M, as implemented in 26 CFR, requires heads of Federal executive agencies to report certain information to the IRS. (b)  (1)             								        The required information applies to contract modifications- (i)                										          Increasing the amount of a contract awarded before January 1,1989, by $50,000 or more; and (ii)                										          Entered into on or after April 1,1990. (2)             								        The reporting requirement also applies to certain contracts and modifications thereto in excess of $25,000 entered into on or after January 1,1989. (c)          						      The information to report is- (1)             								        Name, address, and TIN of the contractor; (2)             								        Name and TIN of the common parent (if any); (3)             								        Date of the contract action; (4)             								        Amount obligated on the contract action; and (5)             								        Estimated contract completion date. (d)          						      Transmit the information to the IRS through the Federal Procurement Data System (see subpart  4.6 and implementing instructions).  4.904 Reporting payment information to the IRS.  26 U.S.C. 6041 and 6041 A, as implemented in 26 CFR, in part, require payors, including Government agencies, to report to the IRS, on Form 1099, payments made to certain contractors.  26 U.S.C. 6109 requires a contractor to provide its TIN if a Form 1099 is required. The payment office is responsible for submitting reports to the IRS.  4.905 Solicitation provision. The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.204-3, Taxpayer Identification, in solicitations that- (a)          						      Do not include the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management; and (b)          						      Are not conducted under the procedures of part  12.  Subpart 4.10 - Uniform Use of Line Items 4.1000 Scope. This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning line items and subline items and their identifiers. However, in order to provide agencies with time to transition their information systems, agencies have until October 1, 2019, to apply the requirements of 4.1002 through 4.1008.  4.1001 Policy. In order to improve the accuracy, traceability, and usability of procurement data, procurement instruments shall identify the supplies or services to be acquired as separately identified line items and, as needed, subline items. (a)          						      Line items are established to define deliverables or organize information about deliverables. Each line item describes characteristics for the item purchased, e.g., pricing, delivery, and funding information. (b)          						      Each line item may be subdivided into separate unique subsets (called subline items) to ease administration. If a line item has deliverable subline items, the line item is informational. Subline items differentiate between or among certain characteristics of the line item, such as colors or sizes, dates of delivery, destinations, or places of performance. Subline items are established to define deliverables or organize information about deliverables.  4.1002 Applicability. The policies of this subpart shall apply to the following procurement instruments, to include amendments, modifications, and change orders thereto: (a)          						      Solicitations. (b)          						      Contracts, including, but not limited to, Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), multi-agency contracts (MACs), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts, indefinite-delivery contracts, and purchase orders. (c)          						      Agreements that include pre-priced supplies or services. (d)          						      Task and delivery orders.  4.1003 Establishing line items. Establish separate line items for deliverables that have the following characteristics except as provided at 4.1005-2: (a)          						      Separately identifiable. (1)             								        A supply is separately identifiable if it has its own identification (e.g., national stock number (NSN), item description, manufacturer's part number). (2)             								        Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one statement of work or performance work statement. (3)             								        If the procurement instrument involves a first article (see subpart  9.3), establish a separate line item for each item requiring a separate approval. If the first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of items that will be approved as a single lot, a single line item may be used. (b)          						      Single unit price or total price. (c)          						      Single accounting classification citation. A single deliverable may be funded by multiple accounting classifications when the deliverable effort cannot be otherwise subdivided. (d)          						      Separate delivery schedule, destination, period of performance, or place of performance. (e)          						      Single contract pricing type (e.g., fixed-price or cost-reimbursement).  4.1004 Establishing subline items. Subline items may be used to facilitate tracking of performance, deliverables, payment, and contract funds accounting or for other management purposes. Subline items may be either deliverable or informational. The list of characteristics at 4.1003 applies to deliverable subline items, but it is not applicable to informational subline items. A line item with subline items shall contain only that information that is common to all subline items thereunder. All subline items under one line item shall be the same contract type as the line item. (a) Deliverable subline items. Deliverable subline items may be used for several related items that require separate identification. For example, instead of establishing multiple separate line items, subline items may be established for- (1)             								        Items that are basically the same, except for minor variations such as– (i)                										          Size or color; (ii)                										          Accounting classification, but see also 4.1005-1(a)(4); or (iii)                										          Date of delivery, destination, or period or place of performance; (2)             								        Separately priced collateral functions that relate to the primary product, such as packaging and handling, or transportation; or (3)             								        Items to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance. (b) Informational subline items. (1)             								        Informational subline items may be used by agencies for administrative purposes. This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the line item and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit). (2)             								        Position informational subline items within the line item description, not in the quantity or price fields.  4.1005 Data elements for line items and subline items. 4.1005-1 Required data elements.  (a)          						      Except as provided in 4.1005-2, each line item or subline item shall include in the schedule (described at 12.303(b)(4), 14.201-2, or 15.204-2, or in a comparable section of the procurement instrument), at a minimum, the following information as separate, distinct data elements: (1)             								        Line item or subline item number established in accordance with agency procedures. (2)             								        Description of what is being purchased. (3)             								        Product or Service Code (PSC). (4)             								        Accounting classification citation. (i)                										          Line items or deliverable subline items. If multiple accounting classifications for a single deliverable apply, include the dollar amount for each accounting classification in the schedule (or a comparable section of the procurement instrument). (ii)                										          Informational subline items. An accounting classification citation is not required. (See 4.1004). (5)  (i)                										          For fixed-price line items: (A)                   												            Unit of measure. (B)                   												            Quantity. (C)                   												            Unit price. (D)                   												            Total price. (ii)                										          For cost-reimbursement line items: (A)                   												            Unit of measure. (B)                   												            Quantity. (C)                   												            Estimated cost. (D)                   												            Fee (if any). (E)                   												            Total estimated cost plus any fee. (b)          						      If a contract contains a combination of fixed-price, time-and-materials, labor-hour, or cost-reimbursable line items, identify the contract type for each line item in the schedule (or a comparable section of the procurement instrument) to facilitate payment. (c)          						      Each deliverable line item or deliverable subline item shall have its own delivery schedule, destination, period of performance, or place of performance expressly stated in the appropriate section of the procurement instrument ("as required" constitutes an expressly stated delivery term). When a line item has deliverable subline items, the delivery schedule, destination, period of performance, or place of performance shall be identified at the subline item level, rather than the line item level. (d)          						      Terms and conditions in other sections of the contract (such as contract clauses or payment instructions) shall also specify applicability to individual line items if not applicable to the contract as a whole.  4.1005-2 Exceptions.  (a) Indefinite-delivery contracts- (1) General. The following required data elements are not known at time of issuance of an indefinite-delivery contract, but shall be provided in each order at the time of issuance: accounting classification, delivery date and destination, or period and place of performance. (2) Indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) and requirements contracts. (i)                										          IDIQ and requirements contracts may omit the quantity at the line item level for the base award provided that the total contract minimum and maximum, or the estimate, respectively, is stated. (ii)                										          Multiple-award IDIQ contracts awarded using the procedures at 13.106-1(a)(2)(iv)(A) or 15.304(c)(1)(ii)(A) may omit price or cost at the line item or subline item level for the contract award, provided that the total contract minimum and maximum is stated (see 16.504(a)(1)). (b) Item description and PSC. These data elements are not required in the line item if there are associated deliverable subline items that include the actual detailed identification. When this exception applies, use a general narrative description for the line item. (c) Single unit price or single total price. The requirement for a single unit price or single total price at the line item level does not apply if any of the following conditions are present: (1)             								        There are associated deliverable subline items that are priced. (2)             								        The line item or subline item is not separately priced. (3)             								        The supplies or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, or labor-hour basis. (4)             								        The procurement instrument is for services and firm prices have been established for elements of the total price, but the actual number of the elements is not known until performance (e.g., a labor-hour contract for maintenance/repair). The contracting officer may structure these procurement instruments to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item.  4.1006 Modifications.  (a)          						      When a new item (such as an increased quantity) is added to the procurement instrument, assign a new line item number. (b)          						      If the modification relates to existing line items, the modification shall refer to those items.  4.1007 Solicitation alternative line item proposal. Solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to propose alternative line items (see 4.1008 and 52.212-1(e)). For example, when soliciting certain items using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot, the offeror may not be able to group and deliver all items in a single shipment.  4.1008 Solicitation provision. Insert the provision at 52.204-22, Alternative Line Item Proposal, in all solicitations.  Subpart 4.11 - System for Award Management 4.1100 Scope.

However, the agency shall inform the contractor of any inconsistencies with the contract information and require that the contractor correct the report, or provide a reasonable explanation as to why it believes the information is correct. Agencies may review the reports at  http://www.fsrs.gov. (b)          						      When contracting officers report the contract action to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) in accordance with FAR subpart  4.6, certain data will then pre-populate from FPDS, to assist contractors in completing and submitting their reports. If data originating from FPDS is found by the contractor to be in error when the contractor completes the subcontract report, the contractor should notify the Government contracting officer, who is responsible for correcting the data in FPDS. Contracts reported using the generic entity identifier allowed at FAR 4.605(c)(2) will interfere with the contractor’s ability to comply with this reporting requirement, because the data will not pre-populate from FPDS. (c)          						      If the contractor fails to comply with the reporting requirements, the contracting officer shall exercise appropriate contractual remedies. In addition, the contracting officer shall make the contractor’s failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the contractor’s performance information under subpart  42.15. (d)          						      There is a reporting exception in 52.204-10(g) for contractors and subcontractors who had gross income in the previous tax year under $300,000.  4.1403 Contract clause.  (a)          						      Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards, in all solicitations and contracts of $30,000 or more. (b)          						      The clause is not prescribed for contracts that are not required to be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) (see subpart  4.6).  Subpart 4.15 - [Reserved] 4.1500 [Reserved] 4.1501 [Reserved] 4.1502 [Reserved]  Subpart 4.16 - Unique Procurement Instrument Identifiers 4.1600 Scope of subpart. This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning unique Procurement Instrument Identifiers (PIID) for each solicitation, contract, agreement, or order and related procurement instrument.  4.1601 Policy.  (a)          						      Establishment of a Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Agencies shall have in place a process that ensures that each PIID used to identify a solicitation or contract action is unique Governmentwide, and will remain so for at least 20 years from the date of contract award. The PIID shall be used to identify all solicitation and contract actions. The PIID shall also be used to identify solicitation and contract actions in designated support and reporting systems (e.g., Federal Procurement Data System, System for Award Management), in accordance with regulations, applicable authorities, and agency policies and procedures.) (b)          						      Transition of PIID numbering. No later than October 1, 2017, agencies shall comply with paragraph (a) of this section and use the requirements in 4.1602 and 4.1603 for all new solicitations and contract awards. Until an agency’s transition is complete, it shall maintain its 2013 PIID format that is on record with the General Services Administration’s Integrated Award Environment Program Office (which maintains a registry of the agency unique identifier scheme). The 2013 PIID format consisted of alpha characters in the first positions to indicate the agency, followed by alpha-numeric characters; the 2017 format instead has the AAC in the beginning 6 positions. (c)          						      Change in the Procurement Instrument Identifier after its assignment. (1)             								        Agencies shall not change the PIID unless one of the following two circumstances apply: (i)                										          The PIID serial numbering system is exhausted. In this instance, the contracting officer may assign a new PIID by issuing a contract modification. (ii)                										          Continued use of a PIID is administratively burdensome (e.g., for implementations of new agency contract writing systems). In this instance, the contracting officer may assign a new PIID by issuing a contract modification. (2)             								        The modification shall clearly identify both the original and the newly assigned PIID. Issuance of a new PIID is an administrative change (see 43.101).  4.1602 Identifying the PIID and supplementary PIID.  (a) Identifying the PIID in solicitation and contract award documentation (including forms and electronic generated formats). Agencies shall include all PIIDs for all related procurement actions as identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. (1) Solicitation. Identify the PIID for all solicitations. For amendments to solicitations, identify a supplementary PIID, in conjunction with the PIID for the solicitation. (2) Contracts and purchase orders. Identify the PIID for contracts and purchase orders. (3) Delivery and task orders. For delivery and task orders placed by an agency under a contract (e.g., indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, multi-agency contracts (MAC), Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), or Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contracts), identify the PIID for the delivery and task order and the PIID for the contract. (4) Blanket purchase agreements and basic ordering agreements. Identify the PIID for blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with 13.303, and for basic agreements and basic ordering agreements issued in accordance with subpart 16.7. For blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with subpart 8.4 under a MAS contract, identify the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement and the PIID for the MAS contract. (i) Orders. For orders against basic ordering agreements or blanket purchase agreements issued in accordance with 13.303, identify the PIID for the order and the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement or basic ordering agreement. (ii) Orders under subpart 8.4. For orders against a blanket purchase agreement established under a MAS contract, identify the PIID for the order, the PIID for the blanket purchase agreement, and the PIID for the MAS contract. (5) Modifications. For modifications to actions described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section, and in accordance with agency procedures, identify a supplementary PIID for the modification in conjunction with the PIID for the contract, order, or agreement being modified. (b) Placement of the PIID on forms. When the form (including electronic generated format) does not provide spaces or fields for the PIID or supplementary PIID required in paragraph (a) of this section, identify the PIID in accordance with agency procedures. (c)          						      Additional agency specific identification information. If agency procedures require additional identification information in solicitations, contracts, or other related procurement instruments for administrative purposes, separate and clearly identify the additional information from the PIID.  4.1603 Procedures.  (a) Elements of a PIID. The	PIID consists of a combination of thirteen to seventeen alpha and/or	numeric characters sequenced to convey certain information. Do not	use special characters (such as hyphens, dashes, or spaces). (1) Positions	1 through 6. The first six positions identify the department/agency	and office issuing the instrument. Use the AAC assigned to the issuing	office for positions 1 through 6. Civilian agency points of contact	for obtaining an AAC are on the AAC Contact list maintained by the	General Services Administration and can be found at  https://community.max.gov/x/24foL. For	Department of Defense (DoD) inquiries, contact the service/agency	Central Service Point or DoD AAC Monitor, or if unknown, email  DODAADHQ@DLA.MIL for	assistance. (2) Positions	7 through 8. The seventh and eighth positions are the last two	digits of the fiscal year in which the procurement instrument is	issued or awarded. This is the date the action is signed, not the	effective date if the effective date is different. (3) Position	9. Indicate the type of instrument by entering one of the following	upper case letters in position nine. Departments and independent	agencies may assign those letters identified for department use	below in accordance with their agency policy; however, any use must	be applied to the entire department or agency. Instrument Letter designation (i) Blanket purchase agreements  A  (ii) invitations for bids  B  (iii)Contracts of all types except indefinite-delivery	contracts (see subpart 16.5)  C  (iv) Indefinite-delivery contracts (including	Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs),	and multi-agency contracts)  D  (v) Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide	use  E  (vi) Task orders, delivery orders or calls	under– Indefinite-delivery contracts (including Federal Supply	Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and multi-agency	contracts); Blanket purchase agreements; or Basic ordering	agreements  F  (vii) Basic ordering agreements.  G  (viii) Agreements, including basic agreements	and loan agreements, but excluding blanket purchase agreements,	basic ordering agreements, and leases. Do not use this code for	contracts or agreements with provisions for orders or calls  H  (ix) Do not use this letter  I  (x) Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide	use  J  (xi) Reserved for departmental or agency	use  K  (xii) Lease agreements  L  (xiii) Reserved for departmental or agency	use  M  (xiv) Reserved for departmental or agency	use  N  (xv) Do not use this letter  O  (xvi) Purchase orders (assign V if numbering	capacity of P is exhausted during a fiscal year)  P  (xvii) Requests for quotations (assign U	if numbering capacity of Q is exhausted during a fiscal year)  Q  (xviii) Requests for proposals  R  (xix) Reserved for departmental or agency	use  S  (xx) Reserved for departmental or agency	use  T  (xxi) See Q, requests for quotations  U  (xxii) See P, purchase orders  V  (xxiii) Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide	use  W  (xxiv) Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide	use  X  (xxv) Imprest fund  Y  (xxvi) Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide	use  Z  (4)             								        Positions	10 through 17. Enter the number assigned by the issuing agency in	these positions. Agencies may choose a minimum of four characters	up to a maximum of eight characters to be used, but the same number	of characters must be used agency-wide. If a number less than the	maximum is used, do not use leading or trailing zeroes to make it	equal the maximum in any system or data transmission. A separate	series of numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed	in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An agency may reserve blocks	of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various components. (5)             								        Illustration	of PIID. The following illustrates a properly configured PIID using	four characters in the final positions: (b) Elements	of a supplementary PIID. Use the supplementary PIID to identify	amendments to solicitations and modifications to contracts, orders,	and agreements. The supplementary PIID is reported as a separate	data element used in conjunction with, but not appended to, the	PIID. (1)             								        Amendments to solicitations. Number	amendments to solicitations sequentially using a four position numeric	serial number added to the 13-17 character PIID beginning with 0001. (2)             								        Modifications	to contracts, orders, and agreements. Number modifications to contracts,	orders, and agreements using a six position alpha or numeric, or	a combination thereof, added to the 13-17 character PIID. For example,	a modification could be numbered P00001. This would be added to	the end of the 13-17 character PIID illustrated in (a)(5) of this	section. (i)                										          Position 1. Identify the office	issuing the modification. The letter P shall be designated for modifications	issued by the procuring contracting office. The letter A shall be	used for modifications issued by the contract administration office	(if other than the procuring contracting office). (ii)                										          Positions	2 through 6. These positions may be alpha, numeric, or a combination	thereof, in accordance with agency procedures. (iii)                										          Each	office authorized to issue modifications shall assign the supplementary	identification numbers in sequence (unless provided otherwise in	agency procedures). Do not assign the numbers until it has been	determined that a modification is to be issued.  Subpart 4.17 - Service Contracts Inventory 4.1700 Scope of subpart. This subpart implements section 743(a) of Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub.
