(e) 						      Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance.  23.403 Policy. Government policy on the use of products containing recovered materials and biobased products considers cost, availability of competition, and performance. Agencies shall purchase these products or require in the acquisition of services, the delivery, use, or furnishing (see 23.103(b)) of such products. Agency contracts should specify that these products are composed of the highest percent of recovered material or biobased content practicable, or at least meet, but may exceed, the minimum recovered materials or biobased content of an EPA- or USDA- designated product. Agencies shall purchase these products to the maximum extent practicable without jeopardizing the intended use of the product while maintaining a satisfactory level of competition at a reasonable price. Such products shall meet the reasonable performance standards of the agency and be acquired competitively, in a cost-effective manner. Except as provided at 23.404(b), virgin material shall not be required by the solicitation (see 11.302).  23.404 Agency affirmative procurement programs.  (a) 						      An agency must establish an affirmative procurement program for EPA and USDA-designated items if the agency’s purchases of designated items exceed the threshold set forth in 23.400. (1) 								        Agencies have a period of 1 year to revise their procurement program(s) after the designation of any new item by EPA or USDA.

(3) 								        Agency affirmative procurement programs must include- (i) 										          A recovered materials and biobased products preference program; (ii) 										          An agency promotion program; (iii) 										          For EPA-designated items only, a program for requiring reasonable estimates, certification, and verification of recovered material used in the performance of contracts. Both the recovered material content and biobased programs require preaward certification that the products meet EPA or USDA recommendations. A second certification is required at contract completion for recovered material content; and (iv) 										          Annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of the program. (b) 						      "Exemptions". (1) 								        Agency affirmative procurement programs must require that 100 percent of purchases of EPA or USDA-designated items contain recovered material or biobased content, respectively, unless the item cannot be acquired- (i) 										          Competitively within a reasonable time frame; (ii) 										          Meeting reasonable performance standards; or (iii) 										          At a reasonable price. (2) 								        EPA and USDA may provide categorical exemptions for items that they designate, when procured for a specific purpose. For example, all USDA-designated items (see 7 CFR 3201.3 (e)) are exempt from the preferred procurement requirement for the following: (i) 										          Spacecraft system and launch support equipment. (ii) 										          Military equipment, i.e., a product or system designed or procured for combat or combat-related missions. (c) 						      Agency affirmative procurement programs must provide guidance for purchases of EPA-designated items at or below the micro-purchase threshold. (d) 						      Agencies may use their own specifications or commercial product descriptions when procuring products containing recovered materials or biobased products. When using either, the contract should specify- (1) 								        For products containing recovered materials, that the product is composed of the- (i) 										          Highest percent of recovered materials practicable; or (ii) 										          Minimum content standards in accordance with EPA’s Recovered Materials Advisory Notices; and (2) 								        For biobased products, that the product is composed of- (i) 										          The highest percentage of biobased material practicable; or (ii) 										          USDA’s recommended minimum contents standards. (e) 						      Agencies shall treat as eligible for the preference for biobased products, products from "designated countries," as defined in 25.003, provided that those products- (1) 								        Meet the criteria for the definition of biobased product, except that the products need not meet the requirement that renewable agricultural materials or forestry materials in such product must be domestic; and (2) 								        Otherwise meet all requirements for participation in the preference program.  23.405 Procedures.  (a) Designated items and procurement guidelines.  (1) Recovered Materials.

As used in this subpart- Computer means a device that performs logical operations and processes data. Computers are composed of, at a minimum:                                          (1) A central processing unit (CPU) to perform operations; (2) User input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, digitizer, or game controller; and (3) A computer display screen to output information. Computers include both stationary and portable units, including desktop computers, integrated desktop computers, notebook computers, thin clients, and workstations. Although computers must be capable of using input devices and computer displays, as noted in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this definition, computer systems do not need to include these devices on shipment to meet this definition. This definition does not include server computers, gaming consoles, mobile telephones, portable hand-held calculators, portable digital assistants (PDAs), MP3 players, or any other mobile computing device with displays less than 4 inches, measured diagonally. Computer display means a display screen and its associated electronics encased in a single housing or within the computer housing (e.g., notebook or integrated desktop computer) that is capable of displaying output information from a computer via one or more inputs such as a VGA, DVI, USB, DisplayPort, and/or IEEE 1394-2008™, Standard for High Performance Serial Bus. Examples of computer display technologies are the cathode-ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD). Desktop computer means a computer where the main unit is intended to be located in a permanent location, often on a desk or on the floor. Desktops are not designed for portability and utilize an external computer display, keyboard, and mouse. Desktops are designed for a broad range of home and office applications. Electronic products means products that are dependent on electric currents or electromagnetic fields in order to work properly. Imaging equipment means the following products:                                          (1) Copier–A commercially available imaging product with a sole function of the production of hard copy duplicates from graphic hard-copy originals. The unit is capable of being powered from a wall outlet or from a data or network connection. This definition is intended to cover products that are marketed as copiers or upgradeable digital copiers (UDCs). (2) Digital duplicator–A commercially available imaging product that is sold in the market as a fully automated duplicator system through the method of stencil duplicating with digital reproduction functionality. The unit is capable of being powered from a wall outlet or from a data or network connection. This definition is intended to cover products that are marketed as digital duplicators. (3) Facsimile machine (fax machine)–A commercially available imaging product whose primary functions are scanning hard-copy originals for electronic transmission to remote units and receiving similar electronic transmissions to produce hard-copy output. Electronic transmission is primarily over a public telephone system but also may be via computer network or the Internet. The product also may be capable of producing hard copy duplicates. The unit is capable of being powered from a wall outlet or from a data or network connection. This definition is intended to cover products that are marketed as fax machines. (4) Mailing machine–A commercially available imaging product that serves to print postage onto mail pieces.

The unit is capable of being powered from a wall outlet or from a data or network connection. This definition is intended to cover products that are marketed as scanners. Integrated desktop computer means a desktop system in which the computer and computer display function as a single unit that receives its AC power through a single cable. Integrated desktop computers come in one of two possible forms:                                          (1) A system where the computer display and computer are physically combined into a single unit; or (2) A system packaged as a single system where the computer display is separate but is connected to the main chassis by a DC power cord and both the computer and computer display are powered from a single power supply. As a subset of desktop computers, integrated desktop computers are typically designed to provide similar functionality as desktop systems. Notebook computer means a computer designed specifically for portability and to be operated for extended periods of time either with or without a direct connection to an AC power source. Notebooks must utilize an integrated computer display and be capable of operation off of an integrated battery or other portable power source. In addition, most notebooks use an external power supply and have an integrated keyboard and pointing device. Notebook computers are typically designed to provide similar functionality to desktops, including operation of software similar in functionality to that used in desktops. Docking stations are considered accessories for notebook computers, not notebook computers. Tablet PCs, which may use touch-sensitive screens along with, or instead of, other input devices, are considered notebook computers. Personal computer product means a computer, computer display, desktop computer, integrated desktop computer, or notebook computer. Television, or TV, means a commercially available electronic product designed primarily for the reception and display of audiovisual signals received from terrestrial, cable, satellite, Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), or other digital or analog sources. A TV consists of a tuner/receiver and a display encased in a single enclosure. The product usually relies upon a cathode-ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma display, or other display technology. Televisions with computer capability (e.g., computer input port) may be considered to be a TV as long as they are marketed and sold to consumers primarily as televisions.  23.702 Authorities.
